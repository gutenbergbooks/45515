  <h1 class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.9ex;"><span class="xxx-larger">The <span
  class="gsp">PREFACE.</span></span></h1>

  <p><i>It may be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the following observations and experiments
  were not drawn up with a view to their being made publick, but were communicated at different
  times, and most of them in letters wrote on various topicks, as matters only of private
  amusement.</i></p>

  <p><i>But some persons to whom they were read, and who had themselves been conversant in
  electrical disquisitions, were of opinion, they contain'd so many curious and interesting
  particulars relative to this affair, that it would be doing a kind of injustice to the publick, to
  confine them solely to the limits of a private acquaintance.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Editor was therefore prevailed upon to commit such extracts of letters, and other
  detach'd pieces as were in his hands to the press, without waiting for the ingenious author's
  permission so to do; and this was done with the less hesitation, as it was apprehended the
  author's engagements in other affairs, would scarce afford him leisure to give the publick his
  reflections and experiments on the subject, finish'd with that care and precision, of which the
  treatise before us shews he is alike studious and capable. He was only apprized of the step that
  had been thus taken, while the first sheets were in the press, and time enough for him to transmit
  some farther remarks, together with a few corrections and additions, which are placed at the end,
  and may be consulted in the perusal.</i></p>

  <p><i>The experiments which our author relates are most of them peculiar to himself; they are
  conducted with judgment, and the inferences from them plain and conclusive; though sometimes
  proposed under the terms of suppositions and conjectures.</i></p>

  <p><i>And indeed the scene he opens, strikes us with a pleasing astonishment, whilst he conducts
  us by a train of facts and judicious reflections, to a probable cause of those ph√¶nomena, which
  are at once the most awful, and, hitherto, accounted for with the least verisimilitude.</i></p>

  <p><i>He exhibits to our consideration, an invisible, subtile matter, disseminated through all
  nature in various proportions, equally unobserved, and, whilst all those bodies to which it
  peculiarly adheres are alike charged with it, inoffensive.</i></p>

  <p><i>He shews, however, that if an unequal distribution is by any means brought about; if there
  is a coacervation in one part of space, a less proportion, vacuity, or want, in another; by the
  near approach of a body capable of conducting the coacervated part to the emptier space, it
  becomes perhaps the most formidable and irresistible agent in the universe. Animals are in an
  Instant struck breathless, bodies almost impervious by any force yet known, are perforated, and
  metals fused by it, in a moment.</i></p>

  <p><i>From the similar effects of lightening and electricity our author has been led to make some
  propable conjectures on the cause of the former; and at the same time, to propose some rational
  experiments in order to secure ourselves, and those things on which its force is often directed,
  from its pernicious effects; a circumstance of no small importance to the publick, and therefore
  worthy of the utmost attention.</i></p>

  <p><i>It has, indeed, been of late the fashion to ascribe every grand or unusual operation of
  nature, such as lightening and earthquakes, to electricity; not, as one would imagine, from the
  manner of reasoning on these occasions, that the authors of these schemes have, discovered any
  connection betwixt the cause and effect, or saw in what manner they were related; but, as it would
  seem, merely because they were unacquainted with any other agent, of which it could not positively
  be said the connection was impossible.</i></p>

  <p><i>But of these, and many other interesting circumstances, the reader will be more
  satisfactorily informed in the following letters, to which he is therefore referred by</i></p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_t.jpg" class="nothand" style="float:left; height:5em;
  margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="T"/><span class="handonly">T</span>HE necessary trouble of copying long
  letters, which perhaps when they come to your hands may contain nothing new, or worth your reading
  (so quick is the progress made with you in Electricity) half discourages me from writing any more
  on that subject. Yet I cannot forbear adding a few observations on M. <i>Muschenbroek</i>'s
  wonderful bottle.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span></div>

  <p>1. The non-electric contain'd in the bottle differs when electrised from a non-electric
  electrised out of the bottle, in this: that the electrical fire of the latter is accumulated <i>on
  its surface</i>, and forms an electrical atmosphere round it of considerable extent: but the
  electrical fire is crouded <i>into the substance</i> of the former, the glass confining it.</p>

  <p>2. At the same time that the wire and top of the bottle, &amp;c. is electrised
  <i>positively</i> or <i>plus</i>, the bottom of the bottle is electrised <i>negatively</i> or
  <i>minus</i>, in exact proportion: <i>i. e.</i> whatever quantity of electrical fire is thrown in
  at top, an equal quantity goes out of the bottom. To understand this, suppose the common quantity
  of Electricity in each part of the bottle, before the operation begins, is equal to 20; and at
  every stroke of the tube, suppose a quantity equal to 1 is thrown in; then, after the first
  stroke, the quantity contain'd in the wire and upper part of the bottle will be 21, in the bottom
  19. After the second, the upper part will have 22, the lower 18, and so on 'till after 20 strokes,
  the upper part will have a quantity of electrical fire equal to 40, the lower part none: and then
  the operation ends: for no more can be thrown into the upper part, when no more can be driven out
  of the lower part. If you attempt to throw more in, it is spued back thro' the wire, or flies out
  in loud cracks thro' the sides of the bottle.</p>

  <p>3. The equilibrium cannot be restored in the bottle by <i>inward</i> communication or contact
  of the parts; but it must be done by a communication formed <i>without</i> the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page3">{3}</span>bottle, between the top and bottom, by some non-electric,
  touching both at the same time; in which case it is restored with a violence and quickness
  inexpressible: or, touching each alternately, in which case the equilibrium is restored by
  degrees.</p>

  <p>4. As no more electrical fire can be thrown into the top of the bottle, when all is driven out
  of the bottom, so in a bottle not yet electrised, none can be thrown into the top, when none
  <i>can</i> get out at the bottom; which happens either when the bottom is too thick, or when the
  bottle is placed on an electric <i>per se</i>. Again, when the bottle is electrised, but little of
  the electrical fire can be <i>drawn out</i> from the top, by touching the wire, unless an equal
  quantity can at the same time <i>get in</i> at the bottom. Thus, place an electrised bottle on
  clean glass or dry wax, and you will not, by touching the wire, get out the fire from the top.
  Place it on a non-electric, and touch the wire, you will get it out in a short time; but soonest
  when you form a direct communication as above.</p>

  <p>So wonderfully are these two states of Electricity, the <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i>, combined
  and balanced in this miraculous bottle! situated and related to each other in a manner that I can
  by no means comprehend! If it were possible that a bottle should in one part contain a quantity of
  air strongly comprest, and in another part a perfect vacuum, we know the equilibrium would be
  instantly restored <i>within</i>. But here we have a bottle containing at the same time a
  <i>plenum</i> of electrical fire, and a <i>vacuum</i> of the same fire; and yet <span
  class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>the equilibrium cannot be restored between them but by a
  communication <i>without</i>! though the <i>plenum</i> presses violently to expand, and the hungry
  vacuum seems to attract as violently in order to be filled.</p>

  <p class="sp3">5. The shock to the nerves (or convulsion rather) is occasion'd by the sudden
  passing of the fire through the body in its way from the top to the bottom of the bottle. The fire
  takes the shortest course, as Mr <i>Watson</i> justly observes: But it does not appear, from
  experiment, that, in order for a person to be shocked, a communication with the floor is
  necessary; for he that holds the bottle with one hand, and touches the wire with the other, will
  be shock'd as much, though his shoes be dry, or even standing on wax, as otherwise. And on the
  touch of the wire (or of the gun-barrel, which is the same thing) the fire does not proceed from
  the touching finger to the wire, as is supposed, but from the wire to the finger, and passes
  through the body to the other hand, and so into the bottom of the bottle.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="gsp"><span class="sc">Experiments</span></span> <i>confirming the
  above</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> I.</p>

  <p>Place an electrised phial on wax; a small cork-ball suspended by a dry silk-thread held in your
  hand, and brought near to the wire, will first be attracted, and then repelled: when in this state
  of repellency, sink your hand, that the ball may be brought towards the bottom of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page5">{5}</span>the bottle; it will there be instantly and strongly
  attracted, 'till it has parted with its fire.</p>

  <p class="sp3">If the bottle had an electrical atmosphere, as well as the wire, an electrified
  cork would be repelled from one as well as from the other.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> II.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</a> From a bent wire (<i>a</i>)
  sticking in the table, let a small linen thread (<i>b</i>) hang down within half an inch of the
  electrised phial (<i>c</i>). Touch the wire of the phial repeatedly with your finger, and at every
  touch you will see the thread instantly attracted by the bottle. (This is best done by a vinegar
  cruet, or some such belly'd bottle). As soon as you draw any fire out from the upper part by
  touching the wire, the lower part of the bottle draws an equal quantity in by the thread.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> III.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.</a> Fix a wire in the lead, with
  which the bottom of the bottle is armed, (<i>d</i>) so as that bending upwards, its ring-end may
  be level with the top or ring-end of the wire in the cork (<i>e</i>), and at three or four inches
  distance. Then electricise the bottle, and place it on wax. If a cork suspended by a silk thread
  (<i>f</i>) hang between these two wires, it will play incessantly from one to the other, 'till the
  bottle is no longer electrised; that is, it fetches and carries fire from the top to the bottom of
  the bottle, 'till the equilibrium is restored.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> IV.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.</a> Place an electricised phial
  on wax; take a wire (<i>g</i>) in form of a C, the ends at such a distance when bent, as that the
  upper may touch the wire of the bottle, when the lower touches the bottom: stick the outer part on
  a stick of sealing wax (<i>h</i>) which will serve as a handle. Then apply the lower end to the
  bottom of the bottle, and gradually bring the upper-end near the wire in the cork. The consequence
  is, spark follows spark till the equilibrium is restored. Touch the top first, and on approaching
  the bottom with the other end, you have a constant stream of fire, from the wire entering the
  bottle. Touch the top and bottom together, and the equilibrium will soon be restored, but silently
  and imperceptibly; the crooked wire forming the communication.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> V.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.</a> Let a ring of thin lead or
  paper surround a bottle (<i>i</i>), even at some distance from or above the bottom. From that ring
  let a wire proceed up, 'till it touch the wire of the cork (<i>k</i>). A bottle so fixt cannot by
  any means be electrised: the equilibrium is never destroyed: for while the communication between
  the upper and lower parts of the bottle is continued by the outside wire, the fire only
  circulates: what is driven out at bottom, is constantly supply'd from the top. Hence a bottle
  cannot be electrised that is foul or moist on the outside.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> VI.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Place a man on a cake of wax, and present him the wire of the electrified phial to
  touch, you standing on the floor, and holding it in your hand. As often as he touches it, he will
  be electrified <i>plus</i>; and any one standing on the floor may draw a spark from him. The fire
  in this experiment passes out of the wire into him; and at the same time out of your hand into the
  bottom of the bottle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> VII.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Give him the electrified phial to hold; and do you touch the wire; as often you
  touch it he will be electrified <i>minus</i>, and may draw a spark from any one standing on the
  floor. The fire now passes from the wire to you, and from him into the bottom of the bottle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> VIII.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Lay two books on two glasses, back towards back, two or three Inches distant. Set
  the electrified phial on one, and then touch the wire; that book will be electrified <i>minus</i>;
  the electrical fire being drawn out of it by the bottom of the bottle. Take off the bottle, and
  holding it in your hand, touch the other with the wire; that book will be electrised <i>plus</i>;
  the fire passing into it from the wire, and the bottle at the same time supply'd from your hand. A
  suspended small cork-ball will play between these books 'till the equilibrium is restored.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> IX.</p>

  <p class="sp3">When a body is electrised <i>plus</i> it will repel an electrified feather or small
  cork-ball. When <i>minus</i> (or when in the common state) it will attract them, but stronger when
  <i>minus</i> than when in the common state, the difference being greater.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> X.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Tho', as in EXPER. VI. a man standing on wax may be electrised a number of times,
  by repeatedly touching the wire of an electrised bottle (held in the hand of one standing on the
  floor) he receiving the fire from the wire each time: yet holding it in his own hand, and touching
  the wire, tho' he draws a strong spark, and is violently shock'd, no Electricity remains in him;
  the fire only passing thro' him from the upper to the lower part of the bottle. Observe, before
  the shock, to let some one on the floor touch him to restore the equilibrium in his body; for in
  taking hold of the bottom of the bottle, he sometimes becomes a little electrised <i>minus</i>,
  which will continue after the shock; as would also any <i>plus</i> Electricity, which he might
  have given him before the shock. For, restoring the equilibrium in the bottle does not at all
  affect the Electricity in the man thro' whom the fire passes; that Electricity is neither
  increased nor diminish'd.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="gsp">EXPERIMENT</span> XI.</p>

  <p>The passing of the electrical fire from the upper to the lower part of the bottle, to restore
  the equilibrium is render'd strongly visible by the following pretty <span class="pagenum"

  eight or ten inches long in the form of (<i>m</i>) <a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.</span>
  5</a>, slip it on the end of the cover of the book over the gold line, so as that the shoulder of
  it may press upon one end of the gold line, the ring up, but leaning towards the other end of the
  book. Lay the book on a glass or wax; and on the other end of the gold lines, set the bottle
  electrised: then bend the springing wire, by pressing it with a stick of wax till its ring
  approaches the ring of the bottle wire; instantly there is a strong spark and stroke, and the
  whole line of gold, which completes the communication between the top and bottom of the bottle,
  will appear a vivid flame, like the sharpest lightning. The closer the contact between the
  shoulder of the wire, and the gold at one end of the line, and between the bottom of the bottle
  and the gold at the other end, the better the experiment succeeds. The room should be darkened. If
  you would have the whole filletting round the cover appear in fire at once, let the bottle and
  wire touch the gold in the diagonally opposite corners.</p>

  <p>In my last I informed you that, in pursuing our electrical enquiries, we had observed some
  particular Ph√¶nomena, which we looked upon to be new, and of which I promised to give you some
  account, tho' I apprehended they might possibly not be new to you, as so many hands are daily
  employ'd in electrical experiments on your side the water, some or other of which would probably
  hit on the same observations.</p>

  <p>The first is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies, both in <i>drawing off</i> and <i>throwing
  off</i> the electrical fire. For example:</p>

  <p>Place an iron shot of three or four inches diameter, on the mouth of a clean dry glass bottle.
  By a fine silken thread from the cieling, right over the mouth of the bottle, suspend a small
  cork-ball, about the bigness of a marble; the <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>thread
  of such a length, as that the cork-ball may rest against the side of the shot. Electrify the shot,
  and the ball will be repelled to the distance of four or five inches, more or less, according to
  the quantity of Electricity.&mdash;When in this state, if you present to the shot the point of a
  long slender sharp bodkin, at six or eight inches distance, the repellency is instantly destroy'd,
  and the cork flies to the shot. A blunt body must be brought within an inch, and draw a spark, to
  produce the same effect. To prove that the electrical fire is <i>drawn off</i> by the point, if
  you take the blade of the bodkin out of the wooden handle, and fix it in a stick of sealing wax,
  and then present it at the distance aforesaid, or if you bring it very near, no such effect
  follows; but sliding one finger along the wax till you touch the blade, and the ball flies to the
  shot immediately.&mdash;If you present the point in the dark, you will see, sometimes at a foot
  distance, and more, a light gather upon it like that of a fire-fly or glow-worm; the less sharp
  the point, the nearer you must bring it to observe the light; and at whatever distance you see the
  light, you may draw off the electrical fire, and destroy the repellency.&mdash;If a cork-ball so
  suspended be repelled by the tube, and a point be presented quick to it, tho' at a considerable
  distance, 'tis surprizing to see how suddenly it flies back to the tube. Points of wood will do as
  well as those of iron, provided the wood is not dry; for perfectly dry wood will no more conduct
  Electricity than sealing wax.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span></div>

  <p>To shew that points will <i>throw off</i> as well as <i>draw off</i> the electrical fire; lay a
  long sharp needle upon the shot, and you cannot electrise the shot, so as to make it repel the
  cork-ball.&mdash;Or fix a needle to the end of a suspended gun-barrel, or iron rod, so as to point
  beyond it like a little bayonet; and while it remains there, the gun-barrel, or rod, cannot by
  applying the tube to the other end be electrised so as to give a spark, the fire continually
  running out silently at the point. In the dark you may see it make the same appearance as it does
  in the case beforementioned.</p>

  <p>The repellency between the cork-ball and the shot is likewise destroy'd; 1. By sifting fine
  sand on it; this does it gradually. 2. By breathing on it. 3. By making a smoke about it from
  burning wood.<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 4. By candle light, even tho' the
  candle is at a foot distance: these do it suddenly.&mdash;The light of a bright coal from a wood
  fire; and the light of red-hot iron do it likewise; but not at so great a distance. Smoke from dry
  rosin dropt on hot iron, does not destroy the repellency; but is attracted by both shot and
  cork-ball, forming proportionable atmospheres round them, making them look beautifully, somewhat
  like some of the figures in <i>Burnet</i>'s or <i>Whiston</i>'s theory of the earth.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page13">{13}</span></div>

  <p><i>N. B.</i> This experiment should be made in a closet where the air is very still.</p>

  <p>The light of the sun thrown strongly on both cork and shot by a looking-glass for a long time
  together, does not impair the repellency in the least. This difference between fire-light and
  sun-light, is another thing that seems new and extraordinary to us.</p>

  <p>We had for some time been of opinion, that the electrical fire was not created by friction, but
  collected, being really an element diffus'd among, and attracted by other matter, particularly by
  water and metals. We had even discovered and demonstrated its afflux to the electrical sphere, as
  well as its efflux, by means of little light windmill wheels made of stiff paper vanes, fixed
  obliquely and turning freely on fine wire axes. Also by little wheels of the same matter, but
  formed like water wheels. Of the disposition and application of which wheels, and the various
  ph√¶nomena resulting, I could, if I had time, fill you a sheet. The impossibility of electrising
  one's self (tho' standing on wax) by rubbing the tube and drawing the fire from it; and the manner
  of doing it by passing the tube near a person or thing standing on the floor, &amp;c. had also
  occurred to us some months before Mr <i>Watson</i>'s ingenious <i>Sequel</i> came to hand, and
  these were some of the new things I intended to have communicated to you.&mdash;But now I need
  only mention some particulars not hinted in that piece, with our reasonings thereupon; though
  perhaps the latter might well enough be spared.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page14">{14}</span></div>

  <p>1. A person standing on wax, and rubbing the tube, and another person on wax drawing the fire;
  they will both of them, (provided they do not stand so as to touch one another) appear to be
  electrised, to a person standing on the floor; that is, he will perceive a spark on approaching
  each of them with his knuckle.</p>

  <p>2. But if the persons on wax touch one another during the exciting of the tube, neither of them
  will appear to be electrised.</p>

  <p>3. If they touch one another after exciting the tube, and drawing the fire as aforesaid, there
  will be a stronger spark between them, than was between either of them and the person on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>4. After such strong spark, neither of them discover any electricity.</p>

  <p>These appearances we attempt to account for thus. We suppose as aforesaid, that electrical fire
  is a common element, of which every one of the three persons abovementioned has his equal share,
  before any operation is begun with the Tube. <i>A</i>, who stands on wax and rubs the tube
  collects the electrical fire from himself into the glass; and his communication with the common
  stock being cut off by the wax, his body is not again immediately supply'd. <i>B</i>, (who stands
  on wax likewise) passing his knuckle along near the tube, receives the fire which was collected by
  the glass from <i>A</i>; and his communication with the common stock being likewise cut off, he
  retains the additional quantity received.&mdash;To <i>C</i>, standing on the floor, both appear to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page15">{15}</span>be electrised: for he having only the middle quantity
  of electrical fire, receives a spark upon approaching <i>B</i>, who has an over quantity; but
  gives one to <i>A</i>, who has an under quantity. If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> approach to touch each
  other, the spark is stronger, because the difference between them is greater; after such touch
  there is no spark between either of them and <i>C</i>, because the electrical fire in all is
  reduced to the original equality. If they touch while electrising, the equality is never
  destroy'd, the fire only circulating. Hence have arisen some new terms among us: we say, <i>B</i>,
  (and bodies like circumstanced) is electrised <i>positively</i>; <i>A</i>, <i>negatively</i>. Or
  rather, <i>B</i> is electrised <i>plus</i>; <i>A</i>, <i>minus</i>. And we daily in our
  experiments electrise bodies <i>plus</i> or <i>minus</i> as we think proper.&mdash;To electrise
  <i>plus</i> or <i>minus</i>, no more needs to be known than this, that the parts of the tube or
  sphere that are rubbed, do, in the instant of the friction attract the electrical fire, and
  therefore take it from the thing rubbing: the same parts immediately, as the friction upon them
  ceases, are disposed to give the fire they have received, to any body that has less. Thus you may
  circulate it, as Mr <i>Watson</i> has shewn; you may also accumulate or substract it upon or from
  any body, as you connect that body with the rubber or with the receiver, the communication with
  the common stock being cut off. We think that ingenious gentleman was deceived, when he imagined
  (in his <i>Sequel</i>) that the electrical fire came down the wire from the cieling to the
  gun-barrel, thence to the sphere, and so electrised the machine <span class="pagenum"
  id="page16">{16}</span>and the man turning the wheel, <i>&amp;c.</i> We suppose it was <i>driven
  off</i>, and not brought on thro' that wire; and that the machine and man, <i>&amp;c.</i> were
  electrised <i>minus</i>; <i>i. e.</i> had less electrical fire in them than things in common.</p>

  <p>As the vessel is just upon sailing, I cannot give you so large an account of American
  Electricity as I intended: I shall only mention a few particulars more.&mdash;We find granulated
  lead better to fill the phial with, than water, being easily warmed, and keeping warm and dry in
  damp air.&mdash;We fire spirits with the wire of the phial.&mdash;We light candles, just blown
  out, by drawing a spark among the smoke between the wire and snuffers.&mdash;We represent
  lightning, by passing the wire in the dark over a china plate that has gilt flowers, or applying
  it to gilt frames of looking-glasses, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;We electrise a person twenty or more
  times running, with a touch of the finger on the wire, thus: He stands on wax. Give him the
  electrised bottle in his hand. Touch the wire with your finger, and then touch his hand or face;
  there are sparks every time.&mdash;We encrease the force of the electrical kiss vastly, thus: Let
  <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> stand on wax; give one of them the electrised phial in hand; let the other
  take hold of the wire; there will be a small spark; but when their lips approach, they will be
  struck and shock'd. The same if another gentleman and lady, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, standing also
  on wax, and joining hands with <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, salute, or shake hands.&mdash;We suspend by
  fine silk thread a counterfeit spider, made of a small piece of burnt cork, with legs of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page17">{17}</span>linnen thread, and a grain or two of lead stuck in him to
  give him more weight. Upon the table, over which he hangs, we stick a wire upright as high as the
  phial and wire, two or three inches from the spider; then we animate him by setting the
  electrified phial at the same distance on the other side of him; he will immediately fly to the
  wire of the phial, bend his legs in touching it, then spring off, and fly to the wire in the
  table; thence again to the wire of the phial, playing with his legs against both in a very
  entertaining manner, appearing perfectly alive to persons unacquainted. He will continue this
  motion an hour or more in dry weather.&mdash;We electrify, upon wax in the dark, a book that has a
  double line of gold round upon the covers, and then apply a knuckle to the gilding; the fire
  appears every where upon the gold like a flash of lightning: not upon the leather, nor, if you
  touch the leather instead of the gold. We rub our tubes with buckskin, and observe always to keep
  the same side to the tube, and never to sully the tube by handling; thus they work readily and
  easily, without the least fatigue; especially if kept in tight pastboard cases, lined with
  flannel, and fitting closeto the tube.<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&mdash;This I
  mention because the <i>European</i> papers, on Electricity, frequently speak of rubbing the tube,
  as a fatiguing exercise. Our spheres are fixed on iron axes, which pass through them. At one end
  of the <span class="pagenum" id="page18">{18}</span>axis there is a small handle, with which we
  turn the sphere like a common grindstone. This we find very commodious, as the machine takes up
  but little room, is portable, and may be enclosed in a tight box, when not in use. 'Tis true, the
  sphere does not turn so swift, as when the great wheel is used: but swiftness we think of little
  importance, since a few turns will charge the phial, <i>&amp;c.</i> sufficiently.</p>

  </div>

  <p>¬ß 1. There will be the same explosion and shock, if the electrified phial is held in one hand
  by the hook, and the coating touch'd with the other, as when held by the coating, and touch'd at
  the hook.</p>

  <p>2. To take the charg'd phial safely by the hook, and not at the same time diminish its force,
  it must first be set down on an electric <i>per se</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The phial will be electrified as strongly, if held by the hook, and the coating apply'd to
  the globe or tube; as when held by the coating, and the hook apply'd.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page20">{20}</span></div>

  <p>4. But the <i>direction</i> of the electrical fire being different in the charging, will also
  be different in the explosion. The bottle charged thro' the hook, will be discharged thro' the
  hook; the bottle charged thro' the coating, will be discharged thro' the coating, and not other
  ways: for the fire must come out the same way it went in.</p>

  <p>5. To prove this; take two bottles that were equally charged thro' the hooks, one in each hand;
  bring their hooks near each other, and no spark or shock will follow; because each hook is
  disposed to give fire, and neither to receive it. Set one of the bottles down on glass, take it up
  by the hook, and apply its coating to the hook of the other; then there will be an explosion and
  shock, and both bottles will be discharged.</p>

  <p>6. Vary the experiment, by charging two phials equally, one thro' the hook, the other thro' the
  coating: hold that by the coating which was charged thro' the hook; and that by the hook which was
  charg'd thro' the coating: apply the hook of the first to the coating of the other, and there will
  be no shock or spark. Set that down on glass which you held by the hook, take it up by the
  coating, and bring the two hooks together: a spark and shock will follow, and both phials be
  discharged.</p>

  <p>In this experiment the bottles are totally discharged, or the equilibrium within them restored.
  The <i>abounding</i> of fire in one of the hooks (or rather in the internal surface of one bottle)
  being exactly equal to the <i>wanting</i> of the other: and therefore, as each bottle has in
  itself the <i>abounding</i> as <span class="pagenum" id="page21">{21}</span>well as the
  <i>wanting</i>, the wanting and abounding must be equal in each bottle. See ¬ß. 8, 9, 10, 11. But
  if a man holds in his hands two bottles, one fully electrify'd, the other not at all, and brings
  their hooks together, he has but half a shock, and the bottles will both remain half electrified,
  the one being half discharged, and the other half charged.</p>

  <p>7. Place two phials equally charged on a table at five or six inches distance. Let a cork-ball,
  suspended by a silk thread, hang between them. If the phials were both charged through their
  hooks, the cork, when it has been attracted and repell'd by the one, will not be attracted, but
  equally repelled by the other. But if the phials were charged, the one through the hook, and the
  other<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> through the coating, the ball, when it is
  repelled from one hook, will be as strongly attracted by the other, and play vigorously between
  them, 'till both phials are nearly discharged.</p>

  <p>8. When we use the terms of <i>charging</i> and <i>discharging</i> the phial, 'tis in
  compliance with custom, and for want of others more suitable. Since we are of opinion, that there
  is really no more electrical fire in the phial after what is called its <i>charging</i>, than
  before, nor less after its <i>discharging</i>; excepting only the small spark that might be given
  to, and taken from, the non-electric matter, if separated from <span class="pagenum"
  id="page22">{22}</span>the bottle, which spark may not be equal to a five hundredth part of what
  is called the explosion.</p>

  <p>For if, on the explosion, the electrical fire came out of the bottle by one part, and did not
  enter in again by another; then, if a man standing on wax, and holding the bottle in one hand,
  takes the spark by touching the wire hook with the other, the bottle being thereby
  <i>discharged</i>, the man would be <i>charged</i>; or whatever fire was lost by one, would be
  found in the other, since there is no way for its escape: But the contrary is true.</p>

  <p>9. Besides the phial will not suffer what is called a <i>charging</i>, unless as much fire can
  go out of it one way, as is thrown in by another. A phial cannot be charged standing on wax or
  glass, or hanging on the prime conductor, unless a communication be form'd between its coating and
  the floor.</p>

  <p>10. But suspend two or more phials on the prime conductor, one hanging to the tail of the
  other; and a wire from the last to the floor, an equal number of turns of the wheel shall charge
  them all equally, and every one as much as one alone would have been. What is driven out at the
  tail of the first, serving to charge the second; what is driven out of the second charging the
  third; and so on. By this means a great number of bottles might be charged with the same labour,
  and equally high, with one alone, were it not that every bottle receives new fire, and loses its
  old with some reluctance, or rather gives some small resistance to the charging, which in a number
  of bottles <span class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span>becomes more equal to the charging power,
  and so repels the fire back again on the globe, sooner than a single bottle would do.</p>

  <p>11. When a bottle is charged in the common way, its <i>inside</i> and <i>outside</i> surfaces
  stand ready, the one to give fire by the hook, the other to receive it by the coating; the one is
  full, and ready to throw out, the other empty and extremely hungry; yet as the first will not
  <i>give out</i>, unless the other can at the same instant <i>receive in</i>; so neither will the
  latter receive in, unless the first can at the same instant give out. When both can be done at
  once, 'tis done with inconceivable quickness and violence.</p>

  <p>12. So a strait spring (tho' the comparison does not agree in every particular) when forcibly
  bent, must, to restore itself, contract that side which in the bending was extended, and extend
  that which was contracted; if either of these two operations be hindered, the other cannot be
  done. But the spring is not said to be <i>charg'd</i> with elasticity when bent, and discharg'd
  when unbent; its quantity of elasticity is always the same.</p>

  <p>13. Glass, in like manner, has, within its substance, always the same quantity of electrical
  fire, and that a very great quantity in proportion to the mass of glass, as shall be shewn
  hereafter.</p>

  <p>14. This quantity, proportioned to the glass, it strongly and obstinately retains, and will
  have neither more nor less, though it will suffer a change to be made in its parts and situation;
  <i>i. e.</i> we may take away part of it from one <span class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span>of
  the sides, provided we throw an equal quantity into the other.</p>

  <p>15. Yet when the situation of the electrical fire is thus altered in the glass; when some has
  been taken from one side, and some added to the other, it will not be at rest or in its natural
  state, till 'tis restored to its original equality.&mdash;And this restitution cannot be made
  through the substance of the glass, but must be done by a non-electric communication formed
  without, from surface to surface.</p>

  <p>16. Thus, the whole force of the bottle, and power of giving a shock, is in the <span
  class="smaller">GLASS ITSELF</span>; the non-electrics in contact with the two surfaces, serving
  only to <i>give</i> and <i>receive</i> to and from the several parts of the glass; that is, to
  give on one side, and take away from the other.</p>

  <p>17. This was discovered here in the following manner. Purposing to analyse the electrified
  bottle, in order to find wherein its strength lay, we placed it on glass, and drew out the cork
  and wire which for that purpose had been loosely put in. Then taking the bottle in one hand, and
  bringing a finger of the other near its mouth, a strong spark came from the water, and the shock
  was as violent as if the wire had remained in it, which shewed that the force did not lie in the
  wire. Then to find if it resided in the water, being crouded into and condensed in it, as connfi'd
  by the glass, which had been our former opinion, we electrify'd the bottle again, and placing it
  on glass, drew out the wire and cork as before; then taking up the bottle we decanted all its
  water into an empty bottle, which likewise stood on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page25">{25}</span>glass; and taking up that other bottle, we expected if the force resided in
  the water, to find a shock from it; but there was none. We judged then, that it must either be
  lost in decanting, or remain in the first bottle. The latter we found to be true: for that bottle
  on trial gave the shock, though filled up as it stood with fresh unelectrified water from a
  tea-pot.&mdash;To find then, whether glass had this property merely as glass, or whether the form
  contributed any thing to it; we took a pane of sash-glass, and laying it on the stand, placed a
  plate of lead on its upper surface; then electrify'd that plate, and bringing a finger to it,
  there was a spark and shock. We then took two plates of lead of equal dimensions, but less than
  the glass by two inches every way, and electrified the glass between them, by electrifying the
  uppermost lead; then separated the glass from the lead, in doing which, what little fire might be
  in the lead was taken out and the glass being touched in the electrified parts with a finger,
  afforded only very small pricking sparks, but a great number of them might be taken from different
  places. Then dexterously placing it again between the leaden plates, and compleating a circle
  between the two surfaces, a violent shock ensued.&mdash;Which demonstrated the power to reside in
  glass as glass, and that the non-electrics in contact served only, like the armature of a
  loadstone, to unite the force of the several parts, and bring them at once to any point desired:
  it being a property of a non-electric, that <span class="pagenum" id="page26">{26}</span>the whole
  body instantly receives or gives what electrical fire is given to or taken from any one of its
  parts.</p>

  <p>18. Upon this, we made what we call'd an <i>electrical-battery</i>, consisting of eleven panes
  of large sash-glass, arm'd with thin leaden plates pasted on each side, placed vertically, and
  supported at two inches distance on silk cords, with thick hooks of leaden wire, one from each
  side, standing upright, distant from each other, and convenient communications of wire and chain,
  from the giving side of one pane, to the receiving side of the other; that so the whole might be
  charged together, and with the same labour as one single pane; and another contrivance to bring
  the giving sides, after charging, in contact with one long wire, and the receivers with another,
  which two long wires would give the force of all the plates of glass at once through the body of
  any animal forming the circle with them. The plates may also be discharged separately, or any
  number together that is required. But this machine is not much used, as not perfectly answering
  our intention with regard to the ease of charging, for the reason given ¬ß 10. We made also of
  large glass panes, magical pictures, and self-moving animated wheels, presently to be
  described.</p>

  <p>19. I perceive by the ingenious Mr <i>Watson</i>'s last book, lately received, that Dr
  <i>Bevis</i> had used, before we had, panes of glass to give a shock; though, till that book came
  to hand, I thought to have communicated it to you as a novelty. The excuse for mentioning it here,
  is, that we <span class="pagenum" id="page27">{27}</span>tried the experiment differently, drew
  different consequences from it, (for Mr <i>Watson</i> still seems to think the fire <i>accumulated
  on the non-electric</i> that is in contact with the glass, page 72) and, as far as we hitherto
  know, have carried it farther.</p>

  <p>20. The magical picture is made thus. Having a large metzotinto with a frame and glass, suppose
  of the <span class="sc">King</span>, (God preserve him) take out the print, and cut a pannel out
  of it, near two inches distant from the frame all round. If the cut is through the picture 'tis
  not the worse. With thin paste or gum-water, fix the border that is cut off on the inside of the
  glass, pressing it smooth and close; then fill up the vacancy by gilding the glass well with leaf
  gold or brass. Gild likewise the inner edge of the back of the frame all round except the top
  part, and form a communication between that gilding and the gilding behind the glass: then put in
  the board, and that side is finished. Turn up the glass, and gild the fore side exactly over the
  back gilding, and when it is dry, cover it by pasting on the pannel of the picture that had been
  cut out, observing to bring the corresponding parts of the border and picture together, by which
  the picture will appear of a piece as at first, only part is behind the glass, and part
  before.&mdash;Hold the picture horizontally by the top, and place a little moveable gilt crown on
  the king's-head. If now the picture be moderately electrified, and another person take hold of the
  frame with one hand, so that his fingers touch its inside gilding, and with the other hand
  endeavour to take <span class="pagenum" id="page28">{28}</span>off the crown, he will receive a
  terrible blow, and fail in the attempt. If the picture were highly charged, the consequence might
  perhaps be as fatal as that of high-treason; for when the spark is taken through a quire of paper
  laid on the picture, by means of a wire communication, it makes a fair hole through every sheet,
  that is, through 48 leaves, (though a quire of paper is thought good armour against the push of a
  sword or even against a pistol bullet) and the crack is exceeding loud. The operator, who holds
  the picture by the upper-end, where the inside of the frame is not gilt, to prevent its falling,
  feels nothing of the shock, and may touch the face of the picture without danger, which he
  pretends is a test of his loyalty.&mdash;If a ring of persons take the shock among them, the
  experiment is called, <i>The Conspirators</i>.</p>

  <p>21. On the principle, in ¬ß 7, that hooks of bottles, differently charged, will attract and
  repel differently, is made, an electrical wheel, that turns with considerable strength. A small
  upright shaft of wood passes at right angles through a thin round board, of about twelve inches
  diameter, and turns on a sharp point of iron fixed in the lower end, while a strong wire in the
  upper-end passing thro' a small hole in a thin brass plate, keeps the shaft truly vertical. About
  thirty <i>radii</i> of equal length, made of sash glass cut in narrow strips, issue horizontally
  from the circumference of the board, the ends most distant from the center being about four inches
  apart. On the end of every one, a brass thimble is fixed. If now the wire of a bottle electrified
  in the <span class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span>common way, be brought near the circumference
  of this wheel, it will attract the nearest thimble, and so put the wheel in motion; that thimble,
  in passing by, receives a spark, and thereby being electrified is repelled and so driven forwards;
  while a second being attracted, approaches the wire, receives a spark, and is driven after the
  first, and so on till the wheel has gone once round, when the thimbles before electrified
  approaching the wire, instead of being attracted as they were at first, are repelled, and the
  motion presently ceases.&mdash;But if another bottle which had been charged through the coating be
  placed near the same wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled by the first, and thereby
  double the force that carries the wheel round; and not only taking out the fire that had been
  communicated to the thimbles by the first bottle, but even robbing them of their natural quantity,
  instead of being repelled when they come again towards the first bottle, they are more strongly
  attracted, so that the wheel mends its pace, till it goes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen
  rounds in a minute, and with such strength, as that the weight of one hundred <i>Spanish</i>
  dollars with which we once loaded it, did not seem in the least to retard its motion.&mdash;This
  is called an electrical jack; and if a large fowl were spitted on the upright shaft, it would be
  carried round before a fire with a motion fit for roasting.</p>

  <p>22. But this wheel, like those driven by wind, water, or weights, moves by a foreign force, to
  wit, that of the bottles. The self-moving wheel, though constructed on the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page30">{30}</span>same principles, appears more surprising. 'Tis made of a thin round plate
  of window-glass, seventeen inches diameter, well gilt on both sides, all but two inches next the
  edge. Two small hemispheres of wood are then fixed with cement to the middle of the upper and
  under sides, centrally opposite, and in each of them a thick strong wire eight or ten inches long,
  which together make the axis of the wheel. It turns horizontally on a point at the lower end of
  its Axis, which rests on a bit of brass cemented within a glass salt-celler. The upper end of its
  axis passes thro' a hole in a thin brass plate cemented to a long strong piece of glass, which
  keeps it six or eight inches distant from any non-electric, and has a small ball of wax or metal
  on its top to keep in the fire. In a circle on the table which supports the wheel, are fixed
  twelve small pillars of glass, at about four inches distance, with a thimble on the top of each.
  On the edge of the wheel is a small leaden bullet communicating by a wire with the gilding of the
  <i>upper</i> surface of the wheel; and about six inches from it is another bullet communicating in
  like manner with the <i>under</i> surface. When the wheel is to be charged by the upper surface, a
  communication must be made from the under surface to the table. When it is well charg'd it begins
  to move; the bullet nearest to a pillar moves towards the thimble on that pillar, and passing by
  electrifies it and then pushes itself from it; the succeeding bullet, which communicates with the
  other surface of the glass, more strongly attracts that thimble on account of its being <span
  class="pagenum" id="page31">{31}</span>before electrified by the other bullet; and thus the wheel
  encreases its motion till it comes to such a height as that the resistance of the air regulates
  it. It will go half an hour, and make one minute with another twenty turns in a minute, which is
  six hundred turns in the whole; the bullet of the upper surface giving in each turn twelve sparks,
  to the thimbles, which make seven thousand two hundred sparks; and the bullet of the under surface
  receiving as many from the thimbles; those bullets moving in the time near two thousand five
  hundred feet.&mdash;The thimbles are well fixed, and in so exact a circle, that the bullets may
  pass within a very small distance of each of them.&mdash;If instead of two bullets you put eight,
  four communicating with the upper surface, and four with the under surface, placed alternately;
  which eight, at about six inches distance, compleats the circumference, the force and swiftness
  will be greatly increased, the wheel making fifty turns in a minute; but then it will not continue
  moving so long.&mdash;These wheels may be applied, perhaps, to the ringing of chimes, and moving
  of light-made Orreries.</p>

  <p>23. A small wire bent circularly with a loop at each end; let one end rest against the under
  surface of the wheel, and bring the other end near the upper surface, it will give a terrible
  crack, and the force will be discharged.</p>

  <p>24. Every spark in that manner drawn from the surface of the wheel, makes a round hole in the
  gilding, tearing off a part of it in coming out; which shews that the fire <span class="pagenum"
  id="page32">{32}</span>is not accumulated on the gilding, but is in the glass itself.</p>

  <p>25. The gilding being varnish'd over with turpentine varnish, the varnish tho' dry and hard, is
  burnt by the spark drawn thro' it, and gives a strong smell and visible smoke. And when the spark
  is drawn through paper, all round the hole made by it, the paper will be blacked by the smoke,
  which sometimes penetrates several of the leaves. Part of the gilding torn off, is also found
  forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the stroke.</p>

  <p>26. 'Tis amazing to observe in how small a portion of glass a great electrical force may lie. A
  thin glass bubble, about an inch diameter, weighing only six grains, being half-filled with water,
  partly gilt on the outside, and furnish'd with a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great a
  shock as a man can well bear. As the glass is thickest near the orifice, I suppose the lower half,
  which being gilt was electrified, and gave the shock, did not exceed two grains; for it appeared,
  when broke, much thinner than the upper half.&mdash;If one of these thin bottles be electrified by
  the coating, and the spark taken out thro' the gilding, it will break the glass inwards at the
  same time that it breaks the gilding outwards.</p>

  <p>27. And allowing (for the reasons before given, ¬ß 8, 9, 10,) that there is no more electrical
  fire in a bottle after charging, than before, how great must be the quantity in this small portion
  of glass! It seems as if it were of its very substance and essence. Perhaps if that due quantity
  of <span class="pagenum" id="page33">{33}</span>electrical fire so obstinately retained by glass,
  could be separated from it, it would no longer be glass; it might lose its transparency, or its
  brittleness, or its elasticity.&mdash;Experiments may possibly be invented hereafter, to discover
  this.</p>

  <p>27. We are surprized at the account given in Mr <i>Watson</i>'s book, of a shock communicated
  through a great space of dry ground, and suspect there must be some metaline quality in the gravel
  of that ground; having found that simple dry earth, rammed in a glass tube, open at both ends, and
  a wire hook inserted in the earth at each end, the earth and wires making part of a circle, would
  not conduct the least perceptible shock, and indeed when one wire was electrify'd, the other
  hardly showed any signs of its being in connection with it.&mdash;Even a thoroughly wet
  pack-thread sometimes fails of conducting a shock, tho' it otherwise conducts electricity very
  well. A dry cake of ice, or an icicle held between two in a circle, likewise prevents the shock;
  which one would not expect, as water conducts it so perfectly well.&mdash;Gilding on a new book,
  though at first it conducts the shock extremely well, yet fails after ten or a dozen experiments,
  though it appears otherwise in all respects the same, which we cannot account for.</p>

  <p>28. There is one experiment more which surprizes us, and is not hitherto satisfactorily
  accounted for; it is this. Place an iron shot on a glass stand, and let a ball of damp cork,
  suspended by a silk thread, hang in contact with the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page34">{34}</span>shot. Take a bottle in each hand, one that is electrify'd through the hook,
  the other through the coating: Apply the giving wire to the shot, which will electrify it
  <i>positively</i>, and the cork shall be repelled: Then apply the requiring wire, which will take
  out the spark given by the other; when the cork will return to the shot: Apply the same again, and
  take out another spark, so will the shot be electrify'd <i>negatively</i>; and the cork in that
  case shall be repelled equally as before. Then apply the giving wire to the shot, and give the
  spark it wanted, so will the cork return: Give it another, which will be an addition to its
  natural quantity, so will the cork be repelled again: And so may the experiment be repeated as
  long as there is any charge in the bottles. Which shews that bodies having less than the common
  quantity of Electricity, repel each other, as well as those that have more.</p>

  <p>Chagrined a little that we have hitherto been able to produce nothing in this way of use to
  mankind; and the hot weather coming on, when electrical experiments are not so agreeable, 'tis
  proposed to put an end to them for this season, somewhat humorously, in a party of pleasure, on
  the banks of <i>Skuylkill</i>.<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Spirits, at the same

  <p>¬ß. 1. Non-electric bodies, that have electric fire thrown into them, will retain it 'till other
  non-electrics, that have less, approach; and then 'tis communicated by a snap, and becomes equally
  divided.</p>

  <p>2. Electrical fire loves water, is strongly attracted by it, and they can subsist together.</p>

  <p>3. Air is an electric <i>per se</i>, and when dry will not conduct the electrical fire; it will
  neither receive it, nor give <span class="pagenum" id="page37">{37}</span>it to other bodies;
  otherwise no body surrounded by air could be electrified positively and negatively: for should it
  be attempted positively, the air would immediately take away the overplus; or negatively, the air
  would supply what was wanting.</p>

  <p>4. Water being electrified, the vapours arising from it will be equally electrified; and
  floating in the air, in the form of clouds, or otherwise, will retain that quantity of electrical
  fire, till they meet with other clouds or bodies not so much electrified, and then will
  communicate as beforementioned.</p>

  <p>5. Every particle of matter electrified is repelled by every other particle equally
  electrified. Thus the stream of a fountain, naturally dense and continual, when electrified, will
  separate and spread in the form of a brush, every drop endeavouring to recede from every other
  drop. But on taking out the electrical fire, they close again.</p>

  <p>6. Water being strongly electrified (as well as when heated by common fire) rises in vapours
  more copiously; the attraction of cohesion among its particles being greatly weakened, by the
  opposite power of repulsion introduced with the electrical fire; and when any particle is by any
  means disengaged, 'tis immediately repelled, and so flies into the air.</p>

  <p>7. Particles happening to be situated as <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, are more easily disengaged than
  <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, as each is held by contact with three only, whereas <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>
  are each in contact with nine. When the surface of water has the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page38">{38}</span>least motion, particles are continually pushed into the situation
  represented by <a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig. 6</span></a>.</p>

  <p>8. Friction between a non-electric and an electric <i>per se</i>, will produce electrical fire;
  not by <i>creating</i>, but <i>collecting</i> it: for it is equally diffused in our walls, floors,
  earth, and the whole mass of common matter. Thus the whirling glass globe, during its friction
  against the cushion, draws fire from the cushion, the cushion is supplied from the frame of the
  machine, that from the floor on which it stands. Cut off the communication by thick glass or wax
  placed under the cushion, and no fire can be <i>produced</i>, because it cannot be
  <i>collected</i>.</p>

  <p>9. The Ocean is a compound of water, a non-electric, and salt an electric <i>per se</i>.</p>

  <p>10. When there is a friction among the parts near its surface, the electrical fire is collected
  from the parts below. It is then plainly visible in the night; it appears at the stern and in the
  wake of every sailing vessel; every dash of an oar shows it, and every surff and spray: in storms
  the whole sea seems on fire.&mdash;The detach'd particles of water then repelled from the
  electrified surface, continually carry off the fire as it is collected; they rise, and form
  clouds, and those clouds are highly electrified, and retain the fire 'till they have an
  opportunity of communicating it.</p>

  <p>11. The particles of water rising in vapours, attach themselves to particles of air.</p>

  <p>12. The particles of air are said to be hard, round, separate and distant from each other;
  every particle strongly <span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>repelling every other
  particle, whereby they recede from each other, as far as common gravity will permit.</p>

  <p>13. The space between any three particles equally repelling each other, will be an equilateral
  triangle.</p>

  <p>14. In air compressed, these triangles are smaller; in rarified Air they are larger.</p>

  <p>15. Common fire joined with air, increases the repulsion, enlarges the triangles, and thereby
  makes the air specifically lighter. Such Air among denser air, will rise.</p>

  <p>16. Common fire, as well as electrical fire gives repulsion to the particles of water, and
  destroys their attraction of cohesion; hence common fire, as well as electrical fire, assists in
  raising vapours.</p>

  <p>17. Particles of water, having no fire in them, mutually attract each other. Three particles of
  water then being attached to the three particles of a triangle of air, would by their mutual
  attraction operating against the air's repulsion, shorten the sides and lessen the triangle,
  whereby that portion of air being made denser, would sink to the earth with its water, and not
  rise to contribute to the formation of a cloud.</p>

  <p>18. But if every particle of water attaching itself to air, brings with it a particle of common
  fire, the repulsion of the air being assisted and strengthened by the fire, more than obstructed
  by the mutual attraction of the particles of water, the triangle dilates, and that portion of air
  becoming rarer and specifically lighter rises.</p>

  <p>19. If the particles of water bring electrical fire when <span class="pagenum"
  id="page40">{40}</span>they attach themselves to air, the repulsion between the particles of water
  electrified, joins with the natural repulsion of the air, to force its particles to a greater
  distance, whereby the triangles are dilated, and the air rises, carrying up with it the water.</p>

  <p>20. If the particles of water bring with them portions of <i>both sorts</i> of fire, the
  repulsions of the particles of air is still more strengthened and increased, and the triangles
  farther enlarged.</p>

  <p>21. One particle of air may be surrounded by twelve particles of water of equal size with
  itself, all in contact with it; and by more added to those.</p>

  <p>22. Particles of air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the mutual attraction of the
  particles of water, did not the fire, common or electrical, assist their repulsion.</p>

  <p>23. If air thus loaded be compressed by adverse winds, or by being driven against mountains,
  &amp;c. or condensed by taking away the fire that assisted it in expanding; the triangles
  contract, the air with its water will descend as a dew; or, if the water surrounding one particle
  of air comes in contact with the water surrounding another, they coalesce and form a drop, and we
  have rain.</p>

  <p>24. The sun supplies (or seems to supply) common fire to all vapours, whether raised from earth
  or sea.</p>

  <p>25. Those vapours which have both common and electrical fire in them, are better supported,
  than those which have only common fire in them. For when vapours rise <span class="pagenum"
  id="page41">{41}</span>into the coldest region above the earth, the cold will not diminish the
  electrical fire, if it doth the common.</p>

  <p>26. Hence clouds formed by vapours raised from fresh waters within land, from growing
  vegetables, moist earth, &amp;c. more speedily and easily deposite their water, having but little
  electrical fire to repel and keep the particles separate. So that the greatest part of the water
  raised from the land is let fall on the land again; and winds blowing from the land to the sea are
  dry; there being little use for rain on the sea, and to rob the land of its moisture, in order to
  rain on the sea, would not appear reasonable.</p>

  <p>27. But clouds formed by vapours raised from the sea, having both fires, and particularly a
  great quantity of the electrical, support their water strongly, raise it high, and being moved by
  winds may bring it over the middle of the broadest continent from the middle of the widest
  ocean.</p>

  <p>28. How these ocean clouds, so strongly supporting their water, are made to deposite it on the
  land where 'tis wanted, is next to be considered.</p>

  <p>29. If they are driven by winds against mountains, those mountains being less electrified
  attract them, and on contact take away their electrical fire (and being cold, the common fire
  also;) hence the particles close towards the mountains and towards each other. If the air was not
  much loaded, it only falls in dews on the mountain tops and sides, forms springs, and descends to
  the vales in rivulets, which united make larger streams and rivers. If much loaded, the electrical
  fire is at once taken from the <span class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>whole cloud; and, in
  leaving it, flashes brightly and cracks loudly; the particles instantly coalescing for want of
  that fire, and falling in a heavy shower.</p>

  <p>30. When a ridge of mountains thus dams the clouds, and draws the electrical fire from the
  cloud first approaching it; that which next follows, when it comes near the first cloud, now
  deprived of its fire, flashes into it, and begins to deposite its own water; the first cloud again
  flashing into the mountains; the third approaching cloud, and all the succeeding ones, acting in
  the same manner as far back as they extend, which may be over many hundred miles of country.</p>

  <p>31. Hence the continual storms of rain, thunder, and lightning on the east-side of the
  <i>Andes</i>, which running north and south, and being vastly high, intercept all the clouds
  brought against them from the <i>Atlantic</i> ocean by the trade winds, and oblige them to
  deposite their waters, by which the vast rivers <i>Amazons</i>, <i>La Plata</i>, and
  <i>Oroonoko</i> are formed, which return the water into the same sea, after having fertilized a
  country of very great extent.</p>

  <p>32. If a country be plain, having no mountains to intercept the electrified clouds, yet is it
  not without means to make them deposite their water. For if an electrified cloud coming from the
  sea, meets in the air a cloud raised from the land, and therefore not electrified; the first will
  flash its fire into the latter, and thereby both clouds shall be made suddenly to deposite
  water.</p>

  <p>33. The electrified particles of the first cloud close when they lose their fire; the particles
  of the other cloud <span class="pagenum" id="page43">{43}</span>close in receiving it: in both,
  they have thereby an opportunity of coalescing into drops.&mdash;The concussion or jerk given to
  the air, contributes also to shake down the water, not only from those two clouds but from others
  near them. Hence the sudden fall of rain immediately after flashes of lightning.</p>

  <p>34. To shew this by an easy experiment. Take two round pieces of pasteboard two inches
  diameter; from the center and circumference of each of them suspend by fine silk threads eighteen
  inches long, seven small balls of wood, or seven peas equal in bigness; so will the balls
  appending to each pasteboard, form equal equilateral triangles, one ball being in the center, and
  six at equal distances from that, and from each other; and thus they represent particles of air.
  Dip both sets in water, and some cohering to each ball they will represent air loaded. Dexterously
  electrify one set, and its balls will repel each other to a greater distance, enlarging the
  triangles. Could the water supported by the seven balls come into contact, it would form a drop or
  drops so heavy as to break the cohesion it had with the balls, and so fall.&mdash;Let the two sets
  then represent two clouds, the one a sea cloud electrified, the other a land cloud. Bring them
  within the sphere of attraction, and they will draw towards each other, and you will see the
  separated balls close thus; the first electrified ball that comes near an unelectrified ball by
  attraction joins it, and gives it fire; instantly they separate, and each flies to another ball of
  its own party, one to <span class="pagenum" id="page44">{44}</span>give, the other to receive
  fire; and so it proceeds through both sets, but so quick as to be in a manner instantaneous. In
  the collision they shake off and drop their water, which represents rain.</p>

  <p>35. Thus when sea and land clouds would pass at too great a distance for the flash, they are
  attracted towards each other till within that distance; for the sphere of electrical attraction is
  far beyond the distance of flashing.</p>

  <p>36. When a great number of clouds from the sea meet a number of clouds raised from the land,
  the electrical flashes appear to strike in different parts; and as the clouds are jostled and
  mixed by the winds, or brought near by the electrical attraction, they continue to give and
  receive flash after flash, till the electrical fire is equally diffused.</p>

  <p>37. When the gun-barrel (in electrical experiments) has but little electrical fire in it, you
  must approach it very near with your knuckle, before you can draw a spark. Give it more fire, and
  it will give a spark at a greater distance. Two gun-barrels united, and as highly electrified,
  will give a spark at a still greater distance. But if two gun-barrels electrified will strike at
  two inches distance, and make a loud snap, to what a great distance may 10,000 acres of
  electrified cloud strike and give its fire, and how loud must be that crack!</p>

  <p>38. It is a common thing to see clouds at different heights passing different ways, which shews
  different currents of air, one under the other. As the air between the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45">{45}</span>tropics is rarified by the sun, it rises, the denser northern and southern
  air pressing into its place. The air so rarified and forced up, passes northward and southward,
  and must descend in the polar regions, if it has no opportunity before, that the circulation may
  be carried on.</p>

  <p>39. As currents of air, with the clouds therein, pass different ways, 'tis easy to conceive how
  the clouds, passing over each other, may attract each other, and so come near enough for the
  electrical stroke. And also how electrical clouds may be carried within land very far from the
  sea, before they have an opportunity to strike.</p>

  <p>40. When the air, with its vapours raised from the ocean between the tropics, comes to descend
  in the polar regions, and to be in contact with the vapours arising there, the electrical fire
  they brought begins to be communicated, and is seen in clear nights, being first visible where
  'tis first in motion, that is, where the contact begins, or in the most northern part; from thence
  the streams of light seem to shoot southerly, even up to the zenith of northern countries. But
  tho' the light seems to shoot from the north southerly, the progress of the fire is really from
  the south northerly, its motion beginning in the north being the reason that 'tis there first
  seen.</p>

  <p>For the electrical fire is never visible but when in motion, and leaping from body to body, or
  from particle to particle thro' the air. When it passes thro' dense bodies 'tis unseen. When a
  wire makes part of the circle, in the explosion of the electrical phial, the fire, though in great
  <span class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span>quantity, passes in the wire invisibly: but in
  passing along a chain, it becomes visible as it leaps from link to link. In passing along
  leaf-gilding 'tis visible: for the leaf-gold is full of pores; hold a leaf to the light and it
  appears like a net; and the fire is seen in its leaping over the vacancies.&mdash;And as when a
  long canal filled with still water is opened at one end, in order to be discharged, the motion of
  the water begins first near the opened end, and proceeds towards the close end, tho' the water
  itself moves from the close towards the opened end: so the electrical fire discharged into the
  polar regions, perhaps from a thousand leagues length of vaporiz'd air, appears first where 'tis
  first in motion, <i>i. e.</i> in the most northern part, and the appearance proceeds southward,
  tho' the fire really moves northward. This is supposed to account for the <i>Aurora
  Borealis</i>.</p>

  <p>41. When there is great heat on the land, in a particular region (the sun having shone on it
  perhaps several days, while the surrounding countries have been screen'd by clouds) the lower air
  is rarified and rises, the cooler denser air above descends; the clouds in that air meet from all
  sides, and join over the heated place; and if some are electrified, others not, lightning and
  thunder succeed, and showers fall. Hence thunder-gusts after heats, and cool air after gusts; the
  water and the clouds that bring it, coming from a higher and therefore a cooler region.</p>

  <p>42. An electrical spark, drawn from an irregular body at some distance is scarce ever strait,
  but shows <span class="pagenum" id="page47">{47}</span>crooked and waving in the air. So do the
  flashes of lightning; the clouds being very irregular bodies.</p>

  <p>43. As electrified clouds pass over a country, high hills and high trees, lofty towers, spires,
  masts of ships, chimneys, <i>&amp;c.</i> as so many prominencies and points, draw the electrical
  fire, and the whole cloud discharges there.</p>

  <p>44. Dangerous, therefore, is it to take shelter under a tree during a thunder-gust. It has been
  fatal to many, both men and beasts.</p>

  <p>45. It is safer to be in the open field for another reason. When the clothes are wet, if a
  flash in its way to the ground should strike your head, it will run in the water over the surface
  of your body; whereas, if your clothes were dry, it would go thro' the body.</p>

  <p>Hence a wet rat cannot be killed by the exploding electrical bottle, when a dry rat may.</p>

  <p>46. Common fire is in all bodies, more or less, as well as electrical fire. Perhaps they may be
  different modifications of the same element; or they may be different elements. The latter is by
  some suspected.</p>

  <p>47. If they are different things, yet they may and do subsist together in the same body.</p>

  <p>48. When electrical fire strikes thro' a body, it acts upon the common fire contained in it,
  and puts that fire in motion; and if there be a sufficient quantity of each kind of fire, the body
  will be inflamed.</p>

  <p>49. When the quantity of common fire in the body is small, the quantity of the electrical fire
  (or the electrical <span class="pagenum" id="page48">{48}</span>stroke) should be greater: if the
  quantity of common fire be great, less electrical fire suffices to produce the effect.</p>

  <p>50. Thus spirits must be heated before we can fire them by the electrical spark. If they are
  much heated a small spark will do; if not, the spark must be greater.</p>

  <p>51. Till lately we could only fire warm vapours; but now we can burn hard dry rosin. And when
  we can procure greater electrical sparks, we may be able to fire not only unwarm'd spirits, as
  lightning does, but even wood, by giving sufficient agitation to the common fire contained in it,
  as friction we know will do.</p>

  <p>52. Sulphureous and inflammable vapours arising from the earth, are easily kindled by
  lightning. Besides what arise from the earth, such vapours are sent out by stacks of moist hay,
  corn, or other vegetables, which heat and reek. Wood rotting in old trees or buildings does the
  same. Such are therefore easily and often fired.</p>

  <p>53. Metals are often melted by lightning, tho' perhaps not from heat in the lightning, nor
  altogether from agitated fire in the metals.&mdash;For as whatever body can insinuate itself
  between the particles of metal, and overcome the attraction by which they cohere (as sundry
  menstrua can) will make the solid become a fluid, as well as fire, yet without heating it: so the
  electrical fire, or lightning, creating a violent repulsion between the particles of the metal it
  passes thro', the metal is fused.</p>

  <p>54. If you would, by a violent fire, melt off the end of a nail, which is half driven into a
  door, the heat given the <span class="pagenum" id="page49">{49}</span>whole nail before a part
  would melt, must burn the board it sticks in. And the melted part would burn the floor it dropp'd
  on. But if a sword can be melted in the scabbard, and money in a man's pocket, by lightning,
  without burning either, it must be a cold fusion.</p>

  <p>55. Lightning rends some bodies. The electrical spark will strike a hole thro' a quire of
  strong paper.</p>

  <p class="sp5">56. If the source of lightning, assigned in this paper, be the true one, there
  should be little thunder heard at sea far from land. And accordingly some old sea-captains, of
  whom enquiry has been made, do affirm, that the fact agrees perfectly with the hypothesis; for
  that, in crossing the great ocean, they seldom meet with thunder till they come into soundings;
  and that the islands far from the continent have very little of it. And a curious observer, who
  lived 13 years at <i>Bermudas</i>, says, there was less thunder there in that whole time than he
  has sometimes heard in a month at <i>Carolina</i>.</p>

  <p>As you first put us on electrical experiments, by sending to our library company a tube, with
  directions how to use it; and as our honourable proprietary enabled us to carry those experiments
  to a greater height, by his generous present of a compleat electrical apparatus; 'tis fit that
  both should know from time to time what progress we make. It was in this view I wrote and sent you
  my former papers on this subject, desiring, that as I had not the honour of a direct
  correspondence with that bountiful benefactor to our library, they might be communicated to him
  through your hands. In the same view I write, and send you this additional paper. If it happens to
  bring you nothing new (which may well be, considering the number of ingenious men in
  <i>Europe</i>, continually engaged in the same researches) at least it will show, that the
  instruments, put into our hands, are not neglected; and, that if no valuable discoveries are made
  by us, whatever the cause may be, it is not want of industry and application.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><span class="gsp">OPINIONS</span> and <span
  class="gsp">CONJECTURES</span>,<br/>
  <i>Concerning the Properties and Effects of the electrical Matter, arising from Experiments and
  Observations, made in</i> Philadelphia, 1749.</p>

  <p>¬ß 1. The electrical matter consists of particles extreamly subtile, since it can permeate
  common matter, even the densest metals, with such ease and freedom, as not to receive any
  perceptible resistance.</p>

  <p>2. If any one should doubt, whether the electrical matter passes thro' the substance of bodies,
  or only over and along their surfaces, a shock from an electrified large glass jar, taken thro'
  his own body, will probably convince him.</p>

  <p>3. Electrical matter differs from common matter in this, that the parts of the latter mutually
  attract, those of the former mutually repel, each other. Hence the appearing divergency in a
  stream of electrified effluvia.</p>

  <p>4. But tho' the particles of electrical matter do repel each other, they are strongly attracted
  by all other matter.<a id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page52">{52}</span></div>

  <p>5. From these three things, the extreme subtilty of the electrical matter, the mutual repulsion
  of its parts, and the strong attraction between them and other matter, arise this effect, that
  when a quantity of electrical matter, is applied to a mass of common matter, of any bigness or
  length within our observation (which has not already got its quantity) it is immediately and
  equally diffused through the whole.</p>

  <p>6. Thus common matter is a kind of spunge to the electrical fluid. And as a spunge would
  receive no water, if the parts of water were not smaller than the pores of the spunge; and even
  then but slowly, if there were not a mutual attraction between those parts and the parts of the
  spunge; and would still imbibe it faster, if the mutual attraction among the parts of the water
  did not impede, some force being required to separate them; and fastest, if, instead of
  attraction, there were a mutual repulsion among those parts, which would act in conjunction with
  the attraction of the spunge. So is the case between the electrical and common matter.</p>

  <p>7. But in common matter there is (generally) as much of the electrical, as it will contain
  within its substance. If more is added, it lies without upon the surface, and forms what we call
  an electrical atmosphere: and then the body is said to be electrified.</p>

  <p>8. 'Tis supposed, that all kinds of common matter do not attract and retain the electrical,
  with equal strength and force; for reasons to be given hereafter. And that those <span
  class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span>called electrics <i>per se</i>, as glass, &amp;c. attract
  and retain it strongest, and contain the greatest quantity.</p>

  <p>9. We know that the electrical fluid is <i>in</i> common matter, because we can pump it
  <i>out</i> by the globe or tube. We know that common matter has near as much as it can contain,
  because, when we add a little more to any protion of it, the additional quantity does not enter,
  but forms an electrical atmosphere. And we know that common matter has not (generally) more than
  it can contain, otherwise all loose portions of it would repel each other, as they constantly do
  when they have electric atmospheres.</p>

  <p>10. The beneficial uses of this electrical fluid in the creation, we are not yet well
  acquainted with, though doubtless such there are, and those very considerable; but we may see some
  pernicious consequences, that would attend a much greater proportion of it. For had this globe we
  live on as much of it in proportion, as we can give to a globe of iron, wood, or the like, the
  particles of dust and other light matters that get loose from it, would, by virtue of their
  separate electrical atmospheres, not only repel each other, but be repelled from the earth, and
  not easily be brought to unite with it again; whence our air would continually be more and more
  clogged with foreign matter, and grow unfit for respiration. This affords another occasion of
  adoring that wisdom which has made all things by weight and measure!</p>

  <p>11. If a piece of common matter be supposed intirely free from electrical matter, and a single
  particle of the <span class="pagenum" id="page54">{54}</span>latter be brought nigh, 'twill be
  attracted and enter the body, and take place in the center, or where the attraction is every way
  equal. If more particles enter, they take their places where the balance is equal between the
  attraction of the common matter and their own mutual repulsion. 'Tis supposed they form triangles,
  whose sides shorten as their number increases; 'till the common matter has drawn in so many, that
  its whole power of compressing those triangles by attraction, is equal to their whole power of
  expanding themselves by repulsion; and then will such piece of matter receive no more.</p>

  <p>12. When part of this natural proportion of electrical fluid, is taken out of a piece of common
  matter, the triangles formed by the remainder, are supposed to widen by the mutual repulsion of
  the parts, until they occupy the whole piece.</p>

  <p>13. When the quantity of electrical fluid taken from a piece of common matter is restored
  again, it enters, the expanded triangles being again compressed till there is room for the
  whole.</p>

  <p>14. To explain this: take two apples, or two balls of wood or other matter, each having its own
  natural quantity of the electrical fluid. Suspend them by silk lines from the ceiling. Apply the
  wire of a well-charged vial, held in your hand, to one of them (A) <a href="#figures">Fig. 7</a>.
  and it will receive from the wire a quantity of the electrical fluid; but will not imbibe it,
  being already full. The fluid therefore will flow round its surface, and form an electrical
  atmosphere. <span class="pagenum" id="page55">{55}</span>Bring A into contact with B, and half the
  electrical fluid is communicated, so that each has now an electrical atmosphere, and therefore
  they repel each other. Take away these atmospheres by touching the balls, and leave them in their
  natural state: then, having fixed a stick of sealing wax to the middle of the vial to hold it by,
  apply the wire to A, at the same time the coating touches B. Thus will a quantity of the
  electrical fluid be drawn out of B, and thrown on A. So that A will have a redundance of this
  fluid, which forms an atmosphere round it, and B an exactly equal deficiency. Now bring these
  balls again into contact, and the electrical atmosphere will not be divided between A and B, into
  two smaller atmospheres as before; for B will drink up the whole atmosphere of A, and both will be
  found again in their natural state.</p>

  <p>15. The form of the electrical atmosphere is that of the body it surrounds. This shape may be
  rendered visible in a still air, by raising a smoke from dry rosin, dropt into a hot tea-spoon
  under the electrised body, which will be attracted and spread itself equaly on all sides, covering
  and concealing the body. And this form it takes, because it is attracted by all parts of the
  surface of the body, tho' it cannot enter the substance already replete. Without this attraction
  it would not remain round the body, but dissipate in the air.</p>

  <p>16. The atmosphere of electrical particles surrounding an electrified sphere, is not more
  disposed to leave it or <span class="pagenum" id="page56">{56}</span>more easily drawn off from
  any one part of the sphere than from another, because it is equally attracted by every part. But
  that is not the case with bodies of any other figure. From a cube it is more easily drawn at the
  corners than at the plane sides, and so from the angles of a body of any other form, and still
  most easily from the angle that is most acute. Thus if a body shaped as A, B, C, D, E, in <a
  href="#figures">Fig. 8</a>, be electrified, or have an electrical atmosphere communicated to it,
  and we consider every side as a base on which the particles rest and by which they are attracted,
  one may see, by imagining a line from A to F, and another from E to G, that the portion of the
  atmosphere included in F, A, E, G, has the line A, E, for its basis. So the portion of atmosphere
  included in H, A, B, I, has the line A, B, for its basis. And likewise the portion included in K,
  B, C, L, has B, C, to rest on; and so on the other side of the figure. Now if you would draw off
  this atmosphere with any blunt smooth body, and approach the middle of the side A, B, you must
  come very near before the force of your attracter exceeds the force or power with which that side
  holds its atmosphere. But there is a small portion between I, B, K, that has less of the surface
  to rest on, and to be attracted by, than the neighbouring portions, while at the same time there
  is a mutual repulsion between its particles and the particles of those portions, therefore here
  you can get it with more ease or at a greater distance. Between F, A, H, there is a larger portion
  that has yet a less surface to rest on and to attract it; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page57">{57}</span>here therefore you can get it away still more easily. But easiest of all
  between L, C, M, where the quantity is largest, and the surface to attract and keep it back the
  least. When you have drawn away one of these angular portions of the fluid, another succeeds in
  its place, from the nature of fluidity and the mutual repulsion beforementioned; and so the
  atmosphere continues flowing off at such angle, like a stream, till no more is remaining. The
  extremities of the portions of atmosphere over these angular parts are likewise at a greater
  distance from the electrified body, as may be seen by the inspection of the above figure; the
  point of the atmosphere of the angle C, being much farther from C, than any other part of the
  atmosphere over the lines C, B, or B, A: And besides the distance arising from the nature of the
  figure, where the attraction is less, the particles will naturally expand to a greater distance by
  their mutual repulsion. On these accounts we suppose electrified bodies discharge their
  atmospheres upon unelectrified bodies more easily and at a greater distance from their angles and
  points than from their smooth sides.&mdash;Those points will also discharge into the air, when the
  body has too great an electrical atmosphere, without bringing any non-electric near, to receive
  what is thrown off: For the air, though an electric <i>per se</i>, yet has always more or less
  water and other non-electric matters mixed with it; and these attract and receive what is so
  discharged.</p>

  <p>17. But points have a property, by which they <i>draw on</i> as well as <i>throw off</i> the
  electrical fluid, at greater distances <span class="pagenum" id="page58">{58}</span>than blunt
  bodies can. That is, as the pointed part of an electrified body will discharge the atmosphere of
  that body, or communicate it farthest to another body, so the point of an unelectrified body, will
  draw off the electrical atmosphere from an electrified body, farther than a blunter part of the
  same unelectrified body will do. Thus a pin held by the head, and the point presented to an
  electrified body, will draw off its atmosphere at a foot distance; where if the head were
  presented instead of the point, no such effect would follow. To understand this, we may consider,
  that if a person standing on the floor would draw off the electrical atmosphere from an
  electrified body, an iron crow and a blunt knitting kneedle held alternately in his hand and
  presented for that purpose, do not draw with different forces in proportion to their different
  masses. For the man, and what he holds in his hand, be it large or small, are connected with the
  common mass of unelectrified matter; and the force with which he draws is the same in both cases,
  it consisting in the different proportion of electricity in the electrified body and that common
  mass. But the force with which the electrified body retains its atmosphere by attracting it, is
  proportioned to the surface over which the particles are placed; i.e. four square inches of that
  surface retain their atmosphere with four times the force that one square inch retains its
  atmosphere. And as in plucking the hairs from the horse's tail, a degree of strength insufficient
  to pull away a handful at once, could yet easily strip it hair by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page59">{59}</span>hair; so a blunt body presented cannot draw off a number of particles at
  once, but a pointed one, with no greater force, takes them away easily, particle by particle.</p>

  <p>18. These explanations of the power and operation of points, when they first occurr'd to me,
  and while they first floated in my mind, appeared perfectly satisfactory; but now I have wrote
  them, and consider'd them more closely in black and white, I must own I have some doubts about
  them: yet as I have at present nothing better to offer in their stead, I do not cross them out:
  for even a bad solution read, and its faults discover'd, has often given rise to a good one in the
  mind of an ingenious reader.</p>

  <p>19. Nor is it of much importance to us, to know the manner in which nature executes her laws;
  'tis enough if we know the laws themselves. 'Tis of real use to know, that china left in the air
  unsupported will fall and break; but <i>how</i> it comes to fall, and <i>why</i> it breaks, are
  matters of speculation. 'Tis a pleasure indeed to know them, but we can preserve our china without
  it.</p>

  <p>20. Thus in the present case, to know this power of points, may possibly be of some use to
  mankind, though we should never be able to explain it. The following experiments, as well as those
  in my first paper, show this power. I have a large prime conductor made of several thin sheets of
  Fuller's pasteboard form'd into a tube, near 10 feet long and a foot diameter. It is cover'd with
  <i>Dutch</i> emboss'd paper, almost totally gilt. This large <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60">{60}</span>metallic surface supports a much greater electrical atmosphere than a rod
  of iron of 50 times the weight would do. It is suspended by silk lines, and when charg'd will
  strike at near two inches distance, a pretty hard stroke so as to make one's knuckle ach. Let a
  person standing on the floor present the point of a needle at 12 or more inches distance from it,
  and while the needle is so presented, the conductor cannot be charged, the point drawing off the
  fire as fast as it is thrown on by the electrical globe. Let it be charged, and then present the
  point at the same distance, and it will suddenly be discharged. In the dark you may see a light on
  the point, when the experiment is made. And if the person holding the point stands upon wax, he
  will be electrified by receiving the fire at that distance. Attempt to draw off the electricity
  with a blunt body, as a bolt of iron round at the end and smooth (a silversmith's iron punch,
  inch-thick, is what I use) and you must bring it within the distance of three inches before you
  can do it, and then it is done with a stroke and crack. As the pasteboard tube hangs loose on silk
  lines, when you approach it with the punch iron, it likewise will move towards the punch, being
  attracted while it is charged; but if at the same instant a point be presented as before, it
  retires again, for the point discharges it. Take a pair of large brass scales, of two or more feet
  beam, the cords of the scales being silk. Suspend the beam by a packthread from the cieling, so
  that the bottom of the scales may be about a foot from the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page61">{61}</span>floor: The scales will move round in a circle by the untwisting of the
  packthread. Set the iron punch on the end upon the floor, in such a place as that the scales may
  pass over it in making their circle: Then electrify one scale by applying the wire of a charged
  phial to it. As they move round, you see that scale draw nigher to the floor, and dip more when it
  comes over the punch; and if that be placed at a proper distance, the scale will snap and
  discharge its fire into it. But if a needle be stuck on the end of the punch, its point upwards,
  the scale, instead of drawing nigh to the punch and snapping, discharges its fire silently through
  the point, and rises higher from the punch. Nay, even if the needle be placed upon the floor near
  the punch, its point upwards, the end of the punch, tho' so much higher than the needle, will not
  attract the scale and receive its fire, for the needle will get it and convey it away, before it
  comes nigh enough for the punch to act. And this is constantly observable in these experiments,
  that the greater quantity of electricity on the pasteboard tube, the farther it strikes or
  discharges its fire, and the point likewise will draw it off at a still greater distance.</p>

  <p>Now if the fire of electricity and that of lightening be the same, as I have endeavour'd to
  show at large in a former paper, this pasteboard tube and these scales may represent electrified
  clouds. If a tube of only 10 feet long will strike and discharge its fire on the punch at two or
  three inches distance, an electrified cloud of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page62">{62}</span>perhaps 10,000 acres, may strike and discharge on the earth at a
  proportionably greater distance. The horizontal motion of the scales over the floor, may represent
  the motion of the clouds over the earth; and the erect iron punch, a hill or high building; and
  then we see how electrified clouds passing over hills or high buildings at too great a height to
  strike, may be attracted lower till within their striking distance. And lastly, if a needle fix'd
  on the punch with its point upright, or even on the floor below the punch, will draw the fire from
  the scale silently at a much greater than the striking distance, and so prevent its descending
  towards the punch; or if in its course it would have come nigh enough to strike, yet being first
  deprived of its fire it cannot, and the punch is thereby secured from the stroke. I say, if these
  things are so, may not the knowledge of this power of points be of use to mankind, in preserving
  houses, churches, ships, &amp;c. from the stroke of lightning, by directing us to fix on the
  highest parts of those edifices, upright rods of iron made sharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent
  rusting, and from the foot of those rods a wire down the outside of the building into the ground,
  or down round one of the shrouds of a ship, and down her side till it reaches the water? Would not
  these pointed rods probably draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came nigh
  enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible mischief?</p>

  <p>21. To determine the question, whether the clouds <span class="pagenum"
  id="page63">{63}</span>that contain lightning are electrified or not, I would propose an
  experiment to be try'd where it may be done conveniently. On the top of some high tower or
  steeple, place a kind of sentry-box, (as in <a href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig.
  9.</span></a>) big enough to contain a man and an electrical stand. From the middle of the stand,
  let an iron rod rise and pass bending out of the door, and then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed
  very sharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept clean and dry, a man standing on it when
  such clouds are passing low, might be electrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him
  from a cloud. If any danger to the man should be apprehended (though I think there would be none)
  let him stand on the floor of his box, and now and then bring near to the rod, the loop of a wire
  that has one end fastened to the leads, he holding it by a wax handle; so the sparks, if the rod
  is electrified, will strike from the rod to the wire, and not affect him.</p>

  <p>22. Before I leave this subject of lightning, I may mention some other similarities between the
  effects of that, and these of electricity. Lightning has often been known to strike people blind.
  A pigeon that we struck dead to appearance by the electrical shock, recovering life, droop'd about
  the yard several days, eat nothing though crumbs were thrown to it, but declined and died. We did
  not think of its being deprived of sight; but afterwards a pullet struck dead in like manner,
  being recovered by repeatedly blowing into its lungs, when set down on the floor, ran headlong
  against the wall, and on examination <span class="pagenum" id="page64">{64}</span>appeared
  perfectly blind. Hence we concluded that the pigeon also had been absolutely blinded by the shock.
  The biggest animal we have yet killed or try'd to kill with the electrical stroke, was a
  well-grown pullet.</p>

  <p>23. Reading in the ingenious Dr. <i>Hales</i>'s account of the thunder storm at
  <i>Stretham</i>, the effect of the lightning in stripping off all the paint that had covered a
  gilt moulding of a pannel of wainscot, without hurting the rest of the paint, I had a mind to lay
  a coat of paint over the filleting of gold on the cover of a book, and try the effect of a strong
  electrical flash sent through that gold from a charged sheet of glass. But having no paint at
  hand, I pasted a narrow strip of paper over it; and when dry, sent the flash through the gilding;
  by which the paper was torn off from end to end, with such force, that it was broke in several
  places, and in others brought away part of the grain of the Turky-leather in which it was bound;
  and convinced me, that had it been painted, the paint would have been stript off in the same
  manner with that on the wainscot at <i>Stretham</i>.</p>

  <p>24. Lightning melts metals, and I hinted in my paper on that subject, that I suspected it to be
  a cold fusion; I do not mean a fusion by force of cold, but a fusion without heat. We have also
  melted gold, silver, and copper, in small quantities, by the electrical flash. The manner is this:
  Take leaf gold, leaf silver, or leaf gilt copper, commonly called leaf brass or <i>Dutch</i> gold:
  cut off from the leaf long narrow strips the breadth of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page65">{65}</span>a straw. Place one of these strips between two strips of smooth glass that
  are about the width of your finger. If one strip of gold, the length of the leaf, be not long
  enough for the glass, add another to the end of it, so that you may have a little part hanging out
  loose at each end of the glass. Bind the pieces of glass together from end to end with strong silk
  thread; then place it so as to be part of an electrical circle, (the ends of gold hanging out
  being of use to join with the other parts of the circle) and send the flash through it, from a
  large electrified jar or sheet of glass. Then if your strips of glass remain whole, you will see
  that the gold is missing in several places, and instead of it a metallic stain on both the
  glasses; the stains on the upper and under glass exactly similar in the minutest stroke, as may be
  seen by holding them to the light; the metal appeared to have been not only melted, but even
  vitrified, or otherwise so driven into the pores of the glass, as to be protected by it from the
  action of the strongest <i>Aqua Fortis</i> and <i>Ag: Regia</i>. I send you enclosed two little
  pieces of glass with these metallic stains upon them, which cannot be removed without taking part
  of the glass with them. Sometimes the stain spreads a little wider than the breadth of the leaf,
  and looks brighter at the edge, as by inspecting closely you may observe in these. Sometimes the
  glass breaks to pieces: once the upper glass broke into a thousand pieces, looking like coarse
  salt. These pieces I send you, were stain'd with <i>Dutch</i> gold. True gold makes a darker
  stain, <span class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>somewhat reddish; silver, a greenish stain. We
  once took two pieces of thick looking-glass, as broad as a Gunter's scale, and 6 inches long; and
  placing leaf gold between them, put them betwixt two smoothly plain'd pieces of wood, and fix'd
  them tight in a book-binder's small press; yet though they were so closely confined, the force of
  the electrical shock shivered the glass into many pieces. The gold was melted and stain'd into the
  glass as usual. The circumstances of the breaking of the glass differ much in making the
  experiment, and sometimes it does not break at all: but this is constant, that the stains in the
  upper and under pieces are exact counterparts of each other. And though I have taken up the pieces
  of glass between my fingers immediately after this melting, I never could perceive the least
  warmth in them.</p>

  <p>25. In one of my former papers, I mention'd, that gilding on a book, though at first it
  communicated the shock perfectly well, yet fail'd after a few experiments, which we could not
  account for. We have since found, that one strong shock breaks the continuity of the gold in the
  filleting, and makes it look rather like dust of gold, abundance of its parts being broken and
  driven off; and it will seldom conduct above one strong shock. Perhaps this may be the reason;
  when there is not a perfect continuity in the circle, the fire must leap over the vacancies; there
  is a certain distance which it is able to leap over according to its strength; if a number of
  small vacancies, though each be very minute, taken <span class="pagenum"
  id="page67">{67}</span>together exceed that distance, it cannot leap over them, and so the shock
  is prevented.</p>

  <p>26. From the before mentioned law of electricity, that points, as they are more or less acute,
  draw on and throw off the electrical fluid with more or less power, and at greater or less
  distances, and in larger or smaller quantities in the same time, we may see how to account for the
  situation of the leaf of gold suspended between two plates, the upper one continually electrified,
  the under one in a person's hand standing on the floor. When the upper plate is electrified, the
  leaf is attracted and raised towards it, and would fly to that plate were it not for its own
  points. The corner that happens to be uppermost when the leaf is rising, being a sharp point, from
  the extream thinness of the gold, draws and receives at a distance a sufficient quantity of the
  electrical fluid to give itself an electrical atmosphere, by which its progress to the upper plate
  is stopt, and it begins to be repelled from that plate, and would be driven back to the under
  plate, but that its lowest corner is likewise a point, and throws off or discharges the overplus
  of the leaf's atmosphere, as fast as the upper corner draws it on. Were these two points perfectly
  equal in acuteness, the leaf would take place exactly in the middle space, for its Weight is a
  trifle, compared to the power acting on it: But it is generally nearest the unelectrified plate,
  because, when the leaf is offered to the electrified plate at a distance, the sharpest point is
  commonly first affected and raised towards it; so that point, from its greater <span
  class="pagenum" id="page68">{68}</span>acuteness, receiving the fluid faster than its opposite can
  discharge it at equal distances, it retires from the electrified plate, and draws nearer to the
  unelectrified plate, till it comes to a distance where the discharge can be exactly equal to the
  receipt, the latter being lessened, and the former encreased; and there it remains as long as the
  globe continues to supply fresh electrical matter. This will appear plain, when the difference of
  acuteness in the corners is made very great. Cut a piece of <i>Dutch</i> gold (which is fittest
  for these experiments on account of its greater strength) into the form of <a
  href="#figures"><span class="sc">Fig. 10</span></a> the upper corner a right angle, the two next
  obtuse angles, and the lowest a very acute one; and bring this on your plate under the electrified
  plate, in such a manner as that the right-angled part may be first raised (which is done by
  covering the acute part with the hollow of your hand) and you will see this leaf take place much
  nearer to the upper than to the under plate; because, without being nearer, it cannot receive so
  fast at its right-angled point, as it can discharge at its acute one. Turn this leaf with the
  acute part uppermost, and then it takes place nearest the unelectrified plate, because otherwise
  it receives faster at its acute point than it can discharge at its right-angled one. Thus the
  difference of distance is always proportioned to the difference of acuteness. Take care in cutting
  your leaf to leave no little ragged particles on the edges, which sometimes form points where you
  would not have them. You may make this <span class="pagenum" id="page69">{69}</span>figure so
  acute below and blunt above, as to need no under plate, it discharging fast enough into the air.
  When it is made narrower, as the figure between the pricked lines, we call it the <i>Golden
  Fish</i>, from its manner of acting. For if you take it by the tail, and hold it at a foot or
  greater horizontal distance from the prime conductor, it will, when let go, fly to it with a brisk
  but wavering motion, like that of an eel through the water; it will then take place under the
  prime conductor, at perhaps a quarter or half an inch distance, and keep a continual shaking of
  its tail like a fish, so that it seems animated. Turn its tail towards the prime conductor, and
  then it flies to your finger, and seems to nibble it. And if you hold a plate under it at six or
  eight inches distance, and cease turning the Globe, when the electrical atmosphere of the
  conductor grows small, it will descend to the plate and swim back again several times with the
  same fish-like motion, greatly to the entertainment of spectators. By a little practice in
  blunting or sharpening the heads or tails of these figures, you may make them take place as
  desired, nearer, or farther from the electrified plate.</p>

  <p>27. It is said in section 8, of this paper, that all kinds of common matter are supposed not to
  attract the electrical fluid with equal strength; and that those called electrics <i>per se</i>,
  as glass, &amp;c. attract and retain it strongest, and contain the greatest quantity. This latter
  position may seem a paradox to some, being contrary to the hitherto received opinion; and
  therefore I shall now endeavour to explain it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page70">{70}</span></div>

  <p>28. In order to this, let it first be considered, <i>that we cannot, by any means we are yet
  acquainted with, force the electrical fluid thro' glass</i>. I know it is commonly thought that it
  easily pervades glass, and the experiment of a feather suspended by a thread in a bottle
  hermetically sealed, yet moved by bringing a nibbed tube near the outside of the bottle, is
  alledged to prove it. But, if the electrical fluid so easily pervades glass, how does the vial
  become <i>charged</i> (as we term it) when we hold it in our hands? Would not the fire thrown in
  by the wire pass through to our hands, and so escape into the floor? Would not the bottle in that
  case be left just as we found it, uncharged, as we know a metal bottle so attempted to be charged
  would be? Indeed, if there be the least crack, the minutest solution of continuity in the glass,
  though it remains so tight that nothing else we know of will pass, yet the extremely subtile
  electrical fluid flies through such a crack with the greatest freedom, and such a bottle we know
  can never be charged: What then makes the difference between such a bottle and one that is sound,
  but this, that the fluid can pass through the one, and not through the other?<a id="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>29. It is true there is an experiment that at first sight would be apt to satisfy a slight
  observer, that the fire thrown into the bottle by the wire, does really pass thro' <span
  class="pagenum" id="page71">{71}</span>the glass. It is this: place the bottle on a glass stand,
  under the prime conductor; suspend a bullet by a chain from the prime conductor, till it comes
  within a quarter of an inch right over the wire of the bottle; place your knuckle on the glass
  stand, at just the same distance from the coating of the bottle, as the bullet is from its wire.
  Now let the globe be turned, and you see a spark strike from the bullet to the wire of the bottle,
  and the same instant you see and feel an exactly equal spark striking from the coating on your
  knuckle, and so on spark for spark. This looks as if the whole received by the bottle was again
  discharged from it. And yet the bottle by this means is charged!<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> And therefore the fire that thus leaves the bottle, though the
  same in quantity, cannot be the very same fire that entered at the wire; for if it were, the
  bottle would remain uncharged.</p>

  <p>30. If the fire that so leaves the bottle be not the same that is thrown in through the wire,
  it must be fire that subsisted in the bottle, (that is, in the glass of the bottle) before the
  operation began.</p>

  <p>31. If so, there must be a great quantity in glass, because a great quantity is thus discharged
  even from very thin glass.</p>

  <p class="sp4">32. That this electrical fluid or fire is strongly attracted by glass, we know from
  the quickness and violence with which it is resumed by the part that had been deprived of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page72">{72}</span>it, when there is an opportunity. And by this, that we
  cannot from a mass of glass draw a quantity of electrical fire, or electrify the whole mass
  <i>minus</i>, as we can a mass of metal. We cannot lessen or increase its whole quantity, for the
  quantity it has it holds; and it has as much as it can hold. Its pores are filled with it as full
  as the mutual repellency of the particles will admit; and what is already in, refuses, or strongly
  repels, any additional quantity. Nor have we any way of moving the electrical fluid in glass, but
  one; that is, by covering part of the two surfaces of thin glass with non-electrics, and then
  throwing an additional quantity of this fluid on one surface, which spreading in the non-electric,
  and being bound by it to that surface, acts by its repelling force on the particles of the
  electrical fluid contained in the other surface, and drives them out of the glass into the
  non-electric on that side, from whence they are discharged, and then those added on the charged
  side can enter. But when this is done, there is no more in the glass, nor less than before, just
  as much having left it on one side as it received on the other.</p>

  <div class="ac w60 fcenter sp2">

  <p>33. I feel a want of terms here, and doubt much whether I shall be able to make this part
  intelligible. By the word <i>surface</i>, in this case, I do not mean mere length and breadth
  without thickness; but when I speak of the upper or under surface of a piece of glass, the outer
  or inner surface of the vial, I mean length, breadth, and half the thickness, and beg the favour
  of being so understood. Now, I suppose, that glass in its first principles, and in the Furnace,
  has no more of this electrical fluid than other common matter: That when it is blown, as it cools,
  and the particles of common fire leave it, its pores become a vacuum: That the component parts of
  glass are extremely small and fine, I guess from its never showing a rough face when it breaks,
  but always a polish; and from the smallness of its particles I suppose the pores between them must
  be exceeding small, which is the reason that Aqua-fortis, nor any other menstruum we have, can
  enter to separate them and dissolve the substance; nor is any fluid we know of, fine enough to
  enter, except common fire, and the electrical fluid. Now the departing fire leaving a vacuum, as
  aforesaid, between these pores, which air nor water are fine enough to enter and fill, the
  electrical fluid (which is every where ready in what we call the non-electrics, and in the
  non-electric Mixtures that are in the air,) is attracted in: yet does not become fixed with the
  substance of the glass, but subsists there as water in a porous stone, retained only by the
  attraction of the fixed parts, itself still loose and a fluid. But I suppose farther, that in the
  cooling of the glass, its texture becomes closest in the middle, and forms a kind of partition, in
  which the pores are so narrow, that the particles of the electrical fluid, which enter both
  surfaces at the same time, cannot go through, or pass and repass from one surface to the other,
  and so mix together; yet, though the particles of electrical fluid, imbibed by each surface,
  cannot themselves <span class="pagenum" id="page74">{74}</span>pass through to those of the other,
  their repellency can, and by this means they act on one another. The particles of the electrical
  fluid have a mutual repellency, but by the power of attraction in the glass they are condensed or
  forced nearer to each other. When the glass has received and, by its attraction, forced closer
  together so much of this electrified fluid, as that the power of attracting and condensing in the
  one, is equal to the power of expansion in the other, it can imbibe no more, and that remains its
  constant whole quantity; but each surface would receive more, if the repellency of what is in the
  opposite surface did not resist its entrance. The quantities of this fluid in each surface being
  equal, their repelling action on each other is equal; and therefore those of one surface cannot
  drive out those of the other: but, if a greater quantity is forced into one surface than the glass
  would naturally draw in; this increases the repelling power on that side, and overpowering the
  attraction on the other, drives out part of the fluid that had been imbibed by that surface, if
  there be any non-electric ready to receive it: such there is in all cases where glass is
  electrified to give a shock. The surface that has been thus emptied by having its electrical fluid
  driven out, resumes again an equal quantity with violence, as soon as the glass has an opportunity
  to discharge that over-quantity more than it could retain by attraction in its other surface, by
  the additional repellency of which the vacuum had been occasioned. For experiments <span
  class="pagenum" id="page75">{75}</span>favouring (if I may not say confirming) this hypothesis, I
  must, to avoid repetition, beg leave to refer you back to what is said of the electrical phial in
  my former papers.</p>

  <p>34. Let us now see how it will account for several other appearances.&mdash;Glass, a body
  extremely elastic (and perhaps its elasticity may be owing in some degree to the subsisting of so
  great a quantity of this repelling fluid in its pores) must, when rubbed, have its rubbed surface
  somewhat stretched, or its solid parts drawn a little farther asunder, so that the vacancies in
  which the electrical fluid resides, become larger, affording room for more of that fluid, which is
  immediately attracted into it from the cushion or hand rubbing, they being supply'd from the
  common stock. But the instant the parts of the glass so open'd and fill'd have pass'd the
  friction, they close again, and force the additional quantity out upon the surface, where it must
  rest till that part comes round to the cushion again, unless some non electric (as the prime
  conductor) first presents to receive it.<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> But if
  the inside of the globe be lined with a non-electric, the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page76">{76}</span>additional repellency of the electrical fluid, thus collected by friction
  on the rubb'd part of the globe's outer surface, drives an equal quantity out of the inner surface
  into that non-electric lining, which receiving it, and carrying it away from the rubb'd part into
  the common mass, through the axis of the globe and frame of the machine, the new collected
  electrical fluid can enter and remain in the outer surface, and none of it (or a very little) will
  be received by the prime conductor. As this charg'd part of the globe comes round to the cushion
  again, the outer surface delivers its overplus fire into the cushion, the opposite inner surface
  receiving at the same time an equal quantity from the floor. Every electrician knows that a globe
  wet within will afford little or no fire, but the reason has not before been attempted to be
  given, that I know of.</p>

  <p>34. So if a tube lined with a <a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>non-electric, be
  rubb'd, little or no fire is obtained from it. What is collected from the hand in the downward
  rubbing stroke, entering the pores of the glass, and driving an equal quantity out of the inner
  surface into the non-electric lining: and the hand in passing up to take a second stroke, takes
  out again what had been thrown into the outer surface, and then the inner surface receives back
  again what it had given to the non-electric lining. Thus the particles of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page77">{77}</span>electrical fluid belonging to the inside surface go in and out of their
  pores every stroke given to the tube. Put a wire into the tube, the inward end in contact with the
  non-electric lining, so it will represent the <i>Leyden</i> bottle. Let a second person touch the
  wire while you rub, and the fire driven out of the inward surface when you give the stroke, will
  pass through him into the common mass, and return through him when the inner surface resumes its
  quantity, and therefore this new kind of <i>Leyden</i> bottle cannot so be charged. But thus it
  may: after every stroke, before you pass your hand up to make another, let the second person apply
  his finger to the wire, take the spark, and then withdraw his finger; and so on till he has drawn
  a number of sparks; thus will the inner surface be exhausted, and the outer surface charged; then
  wrap a sheet of gilt paper close round the outer surface, and grasping it in your hand you may
  receive a shock by applying the finger of the other hand to the wire: for now the vacant pores in
  the inner surface resume their quantity, and the overcharg'd pores in the outer surface discharge
  that overplus; the equilibrium being restored through your body, which could not be restored
  through the glass.<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> If the tube be exhausted of
  air, a non electric lining in contact with the wire is not necessary; for <i>in vacuo</i>, the
  electrical fire will fly freely from <span class="pagenum" id="page78">{78}</span>the inner
  surface, without a non-electric conductor: but air resists its motion; for being itself an
  electric <i>per se</i>, it does not attract it, having already its quantity. So the air never
  draws off an electric atmosphere from any body, but in proportion to the non-electrics mix'd with
  it: it rather keeps such an atmosphere confin'd, which from the mutual repulsion of its particles,
  tends to dissipation, and would immediately dissipate <i>in vacuo</i>.&mdash;And thus the
  experiment of the feather inclosed in a glass vessel hermetically sealed, but moving on the
  approach of the rubbed tube, is explained: When an additional quantity of the electrical fluid is
  applied to the side of the vessel by the atmosphere of the tube, a quantity is repelled and driven
  out of the inner surface of that side into the vessel, and there affects the feather, returning
  again into its pores, when the tube with its atmosphere is withdrawn; not that the particles of
  that atmosphere did themselves pass through the glass to the feather.&mdash;&mdash;And every other
  appearance I have yet seen, in which glass and electricity are concern'd, are, I think, explain'd
  with equal ease by the same hypothesis. Yet, perhaps, it may not be a true one, and I shall be
  obliged to him that affords me a better.</p>

  <p>35. Thus I take the difference between non electrics and glass, an electric <i>per se</i>, to
  consist in these two particulars. 1st, That a non-electric easily suffers a change in the quantity
  of the electrical fluid it contains. You <span class="pagenum" id="page79">{79}</span>may lessen
  its whole quantity by drawing out a part, which the whole body will again resume; but of glass you
  can only lessen the quantity contain'd in one of its surfaces; and not that, but by supplying an
  equal quantity at the same time to the other surface; so that the whole glass may always have the
  same quantity in the two surfaces, their two different quantities being added together. And this
  can only be done in glass that is thin; beyond a certain thickness we have yet no power that can
  make this change. And, 2dly, that the electrical fire freely removes from place to place, in and
  through the substance of a non-electric, but not so through the substance of glass. If you offer a
  quantity to one end of a long rod of metal, it receives it, and when it enters, every particle
  that was before in the rod, pushes its neighbour quite to the further end, where the overplus is
  discharg'd; and this instantaneously where the rod is part of the circle in the experiment of the
  shock. But glass, from the smallness of its pores, or stronger attraction of what it contains,
  refuses to admit so free a motion; a glass rod will not conduct a shock, nor will the thinnest
  glass suffer any particle entring one of its surfaces to pass thro' to the other.</p>

  <p>36. Hence we see the impossibility of success, in the experiments propos'd, to draw out the
  effluvial virtues of a non-electric, as cinnamon for instance, and mixing them with the electrical
  fluid, to convey them with that into <span class="pagenum" id="page80">{80}</span>the body, by
  including it in the globe, and then applying friction, etc. For though the effluvia of cinnamon,
  and the electrical fluid should mix within the globe, they would never come out together through
  the pores of the glass, and so go to the prime conductor; for the electrical fluid itself cannot
  come through; and the prime conductor is always supply'd from the cushion, and that from the
  floor. And besides, when the globe is filled with cinnamon, or other non-electric, no electrical
  fluid can be obtain'd from its outer surface, for the reason before-mentioned. I have try'd
  another way, which I thought more likely to obtain a mixture of the electrical and other effluvia
  together, if such a mixture had been possible. I placed a glass plate under my cushion, to cut off
  the communication between the cushion and floor; then brought a small chain from the cushion into
  a glass of oil of turpentine, and carried another chain from the oil of turpentine to the floor,
  taking care that the chain from the cushion to the glass touch'd no part of the frame of the
  machine. Another chain was fix'd to the prime conductor, and held in the hand of a person to be
  electrised. The ends of the two chains in the glass were near an inch distant from each other, the
  oil of turpentine between. Now the globe being turn'd, could draw no fire from the floor through
  the machine, the communication that way being cut off by the thick glass plate under the cushion:
  it must then draw it through the <span class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span>chains whose ends
  were dipt in the oil of turpentine. And as the oil of turpentine being an electric <i>per se</i>,
  would not conduct what came up from the floor, was obliged to jump from the end of one chain, to
  the end of the other, through the substance of that oil, which we could see in large sparks; and
  so it had a fair opportunity of seizing some of the finest particles of the oil in its passage,
  and carrying them off with it: but no such effect followed, nor could I perceive the least
  difference in the smell of the electrical effluvia thus collected, from what it has when collected
  otherwise; nor does it otherwise affect the body of a person electrised. I likewise put into a
  phial, instead of water, a strong purgative liquid, and then charged the phial, and took repeated
  shocks from it, in which case every particle of the electrical fluid must, before it went through
  my body, have first gone through the liquid when the phial is charging, and returned through it
  when discharging, yet no other effect followed than if it had been charged with water. I have also
  smelt the electrical fire when drawn through gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, wood, and the human
  body, and could perceive no difference; the odour is always the same where the spark does not burn
  what it strikes; and therefore I imagine it does not take that smell from any quality of the
  bodies it passes through. And indeed, as that smell so readily leaves the electrical matter, and
  adheres to the knuckle receiving the sparks, and to other <span class="pagenum"
  id="page82">{82}</span>things; I suspect that it never was connected with it, but arises
  instantaneously from something in the air acted upon by it. For if it was fine enough to come with
  the electrical fluid through the body of one person, why should it stop on the skin of
  another?</p>

  <p class="sp5">But I shall never have done, if I tell you all my conjectures, thoughts, and
  imaginations, on the nature and operations of this electrical fluid, and relate the variety of
  little experiments we have try'd. I have already made this paper too long, for which I must crave
  pardon, not having now time to make it shorter. I shall only add, that as it has been observed
  here that spirits will fire by the electrical spark in the summer time, without heating them, when
  <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s thermometer is above 70; so, when colder, if the operator puts a small flat
  bottle of spirits in his bosom, or a close pocket, with the spoon, some little time before he uses
  them, the heat of his body will communicate warmth more than sufficient for the purpose.</p>

  electrical fire from the floor to the cushion; then, if there be no fine points or hairy threads

  coating.&mdash;&mdash;But</p>

  <p>Form a communication by a chain from the coating to the cushion, and the phial will charge.</p>

  <p>For the globe then draws the electrical fire out of the outside surface of the phial, and
  forces it, through the prime conductor and wire of the phial, into the inside surface.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page84">{84}</span></div>

  <p>Thus the bottle is charged with its own fire, no other being to be had while the glass plate is
  under the cushion.</p>

  <p>Hang two cork balls by flaxen threads to the prime conductor; then touch the coating of the
  bottle, and they will be electrified and recede from each other.</p>

  <p>For just as much fire as you give the coating, so much is discharged through the wire upon the
  prime conductor, whence the cork balls receive an electrical atmosphere. But</p>

  <p>Take a wire bent in the form of a C, with a stick of wax fixed to the outside of the curve, to
  hold it by; and apply one end of this wire to the coating, and the other at the same time to the
  prime conductor, the phial will be discharged; and if the balls are not electrified before the
  discharge, neither will they appear to be so after the discharge, for they will not repel each
  other.</p>

  <p>Now if the fire discharged from the inside surface of the bottle through its wire, remained on
  the prime conductor, the balls would be electrified and recede from each other.</p>

  <p>If the phial really exploded at both ends, and discharged fire from both coating and wire, the
  balls would be <i>more</i> electrified and recede <i>farther</i>: for none of the fire can escape,
  the wax handle preventing.</p>

  <p>But if the fire, with which the inside surface is surcharged, be so much precisely as is wanted
  by the outside surface, it will pass round through the wire fixed to the wax <span class="pagenum"
  id="page85">{85}</span>handle, restore the equilibrium in the glass, and make no alteration in the
  state of the prime conductor.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Accordingly we find, that if the prime conductor be electrified, and the cork balls
  in a state of repellency before the bottle is charged, they continue so afterwards. If not, they
  are not electrified by that discharge.</p>

    <p>We suppose every particle of sand, moisture, or smoke, being first attracted and then
    repelled, carries off with it a portion of the electrical fire; but that the same still subsists
    in those particles, till they communicate it to something else; and that it is never really
    destroyed.&mdash;So when water is thrown on common fire, we do not imagine the element is
    thereby destroyed or annihilated, but only dispersed, each particle of water carrying off in
    vapour its portion of the fire, which it had attracted and attached to itself.</p>

    <p>To charge a bottle commodiously through the coating, place it on a glass stand; form a
    communication from the prime conductor to the coating, and another from the hook to the wall or
    floor. When it is charged, remove the latter communication before you take hold of the bottle,
    otherwise great part of the fire will escape by it.</p>
